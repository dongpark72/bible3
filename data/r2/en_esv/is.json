      "And I will restore your judges as at the first,\n    and your counselors as at the beginning.\nAfterward you shall be called the city of righteousness,\n    the faithful city.”",
      "Zion shall be redeemed by justice,\n    and those in her who repent, by righteousness.",
      "But rebels and sinners shall be broken together,\n    and those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed.",
