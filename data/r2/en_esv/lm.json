      "How lonely sits the city\n    that was full of people!\nHow like a widow has she become,\n    she who was great among the nations!\nShe who was a princess among the provinces\n    has become a slave.",
      "She weeps bitterly in the night,\n    with tears on her cheeks;\namong all her lovers\n    she has none to comfort her;\nall her friends have dealt treacherously with her;\n    they have become her enemies.",
      "Judah has gone into exile because of affliction\n    and hard servitude;\nshe dwells now among the nations,\n    but finds no resting place;\nher pursuers have all overtaken her\n    in the midst of her distress.",
      "The roads to Zion mourn,\n    for none come to the festival;\nall her gates are desolate;\n    her priests groan;\nher virgins have been afflicted,\n    and she herself suffers bitterly.",

      "From the daughter of Zion\n    all her majesty has departed.\nHer princes have become like deer\n    that find no pasture;\nthey fled without strength\n    before the pursuer.",
      "Jerusalem remembers\n    in the days of her affliction and wandering\nall the precious things\n    that were hers from days of old.\nWhen her people fell into the hand of the foe,\n    and there was none to help her,\nher foes gloated over her;\n    they mocked at her downfall.",
      "Jerusalem sinned grievously;\n    therefore she became filthy;\nall who honored her despise her,\n    for they have seen her nakedness;\nshe herself groans\n    and turns her face away.",
      "Her uncleanness was in her skirts;\n    she took no thought of her future;\ntherefore her fall is terrible;\n    she has no comforter.\n“O Lord, behold my affliction,\n    for the enemy has triumphed!”",
      "The enemy has stretched out his hands\n    over all her precious things;\nfor she has seen the nations\n    enter her sanctuary,\nthose whom you forbade\n    to enter your congregation.",
      "All her people groan\n    as they search for bread;\nthey trade their treasures for food\n    to revive their strength.\n“Look, O Lord, and see,\n    for I am despised.”",
      "“Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?\n    Look and see\nif there is any sorrow like my sorrow,\n    which was brought upon me,\nwhich the Lord inflicted\n    on the day of his fierce anger.",

      "“My transgressions were bound into a yoke;\n    by his hand they were fastened together;\nthey were set upon my neck;\n    he caused my strength to fail;\nthe Lord gave me into the hands\n    of those whom I cannot withstand.",
      "“The Lord rejected\n    all my mighty men in my midst;\nhe summoned an assembly against me\n    to crush my young men;\nthe Lord has trodden as in a winepress\n    the virgin daughter of Judah.",
      "“For these things I weep;\n    my eyes flow with tears;\nfor a comforter is far from me,\n    one to revive my spirit;\nmy children are desolate,\n    for the enemy has prevailed.”",
      "Zion stretches out her hands,\n    but there is none to comfort her;\nthe Lord has commanded against Jacob\n    that his neighbors should be his foes;\nJerusalem has become\n    a filthy thing among them.",
      "“The Lord is in the right,\n    for I have rebelled against his word;\nbut hear, all you peoples,\n    and see my suffering;\nmy young women and my young men\n    have gone into captivity.",
      "“I called to my lovers,\n    but they deceived me;\nmy priests and elders\n    perished in the city,\nwhile they sought food\n    to revive their strength.",
      "“Look, O Lord, for I am in distress;\n    my stomach churns;\nmy heart is wrung within me,\n    because I have been very rebellious.\nIn the street the sword bereaves;\n    in the house it is like death.",
      "“They heard my groaning,\n    yet there is no one to comfort me.\nAll my enemies have heard of my trouble;\n    they are glad that you have done it.\nYou have brought the day you announced;\n    now let them be as I am.",
      "“Let all their evildoing come before you,\n    and deal with them\nas you have dealt with me\n    because of all my transgressions;\nfor my groans are many,\n    and my heart is faint.”"

      "How the Lord in his anger\n    has set the daughter of Zion under a cloud!\nHe has cast down from heaven to earth\n    the splendor of Israel;\nhe has not remembered his footstool\n    in the day of his anger.",
      "The Lord has swallowed up without mercy\n    all the habitations of Jacob;\nin his wrath he has broken down\n    the strongholds of the daughter of Judah;\nhe has brought down to the ground in dishonor\n    the kingdom and its rulers.",
      "He has cut down in fierce anger\n    all the might of Israel;\nhe has withdrawn from them his right hand\n    in the face of the enemy;\nhe has burned like a flaming fire in Jacob,\n    consuming all around.",

      "What can I say for you, to what compare you,\n    O daughter of Jerusalem?\nWhat can I liken to you, that I may comfort you,\n    O virgin daughter of Zion?\nFor your ruin is vast as the sea;\n    who can heal you?",
      "Your prophets have seen for you\n    false and deceptive visions;\nthey have not exposed your iniquity\n    to restore your fortunes,\nbut have seen for you oracles\n    that are false and misleading.",
      "All who pass along the way\n    clap their hands at you;\nthey hiss and wag their heads\n    at the daughter of Jerusalem:\n“Is this the city that was called\n    the perfection of beauty,\n    the joy of all the earth?”",
      "All your enemies\n    rail against you;\nthey hiss, they gnash their teeth,\n    they cry: “We have swallowed her!\nAh, this is the day we longed for;\n    now we have it; we see it!”",
      "The Lord has done what he purposed;\n    he has carried out his word,\nwhich he commanded long ago;\n    he has thrown down without pity;\nhe has made the enemy rejoice over you\n    and exalted the might of your foes.",
      "Their heart cried to the Lord.\n    O wall of the daughter of Zion,\nlet tears stream down like a torrent\n    day and night!\nGive yourself no rest,\n    your eyes no respite!",
      "“Arise, cry out in the night,\n    at the beginning of the night watches!\nPour out your heart like water\n    before the presence of the Lord!\nLift your hands to him\n    for the lives of your children,\nwho faint for hunger\n    at the head of every street.”",
      "Look, O Lord, and see!\n    With whom have you dealt thus?\nShould women eat the fruit of their womb,\n    the children of their tender care?\nShould priest and prophet be killed\n    in the sanctuary of the Lord?",
      "In the dust of the streets\n    lie the young and the old;\nmy young women and my young men\n    have fallen by the sword;\nyou have killed them in the day of your anger,\n    slaughtering without pity.",
      "You summoned as if to a festival day\n    my terrors on every side,\nand on the day of the anger of the Lord\n    no one escaped or survived;\nthose whom I held and raised\n    my enemy destroyed."
