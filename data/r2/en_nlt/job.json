      "There once was a man named Job who lived in the land of Uz. He was blameless—a man of complete integrity. He feared God and stayed away from evil.",
      "He had seven sons and three daughters.",
      "He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 teams of oxen, and 500 female donkeys. He also had many servants. He was, in fact, the richest person in that entire area.",
      "Job’s sons would take turns preparing feasts in their homes, and they would also invite their three sisters to celebrate with them.",
      "When these celebrations ended—sometimes after several days—Job would purify his children. He would get up early in the morning and offer a burnt offering for each of them. For Job said to himself, “Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice.",
      "One day the members of the heavenly court came to present themselves before the Lord, and the Accuser, Satan, came with them.",
      "“Where have you come from?” the Lord asked Satan.\nSatan answered the Lord, “I have been patrolling the earth, watching everything that’s going on.”",
      "Then the Lord asked Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth. He is blameless—a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil.”",
      "Satan replied to the Lord, “Yes, but Job has good reason to fear God.",
      "You have always put a wall of protection around him and his home and his property. You have made him prosper in everything he does. Look how rich he is!",
      "But reach out and take away everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face!”",
      "“All right, you may test him,” the Lord said to Satan. “Do whatever you want with everything he possesses, but don’t harm him physically.” So Satan left the Lord’s presence.",
      "One day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting at the oldest brother’s house,",
      "a messenger arrived at Job’s home with this news: “Your oxen were plowing, with the donkeys feeding beside them,",
      "when the Sabeans raided us. They stole all the animals and killed all the farmhands. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”",
      "While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news: “The fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up your sheep and all the shepherds. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”",
      "While he was still speaking, a third messenger arrived with this news: “Three bands of Chaldean raiders have stolen your camels and killed your servants. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”",
      "While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news: “Your sons and daughters were feasting in their oldest brother’s home.",
      "Suddenly, a powerful wind swept in from the wilderness and hit the house on all sides. The house collapsed, and all your children are dead. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”",
      "Job stood up and tore his robe in grief. Then he shaved his head and fell to the ground to worship.",
      "He said, \n“I came naked from my mother’s womb,\n    and I will be naked when I leave.\nThe Lord gave me what I had,\n    and the Lord has taken it away.\nPraise the name of the Lord!”",
      "In all of this, Job did not sin by blaming God."

      "One day the members of the heavenly court came again to present themselves before the Lord, and the Accuser, Satan, came with them.",
      "“Where have you come from?” the Lord asked Satan.\nSatan answered the Lord, “I have been patrolling the earth, watching everything that’s going on.”",
      "Then the Lord asked Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth. He is blameless—a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil. And he has maintained his integrity, even though you urged me to harm him without cause.”",
      "Satan replied to the Lord, “Skin for skin! A man will give up everything he has to save his life.",
      "But reach out and take away his health, and he will surely curse you to your face!”",
      "“All right, do with him as you please,” the Lord said to Satan. “But spare his life.”",
      "So Satan left the Lord’s presence, and he struck Job with terrible boils from head to foot.",
      "Job scraped his skin with a piece of broken pottery as he sat among the ashes.",
      "His wife said to him, “Are you still trying to maintain your integrity? Curse God and die.”",
      "But Job replied, “You talk like a foolish woman. Should we accept only good things from the hand of God and never anything bad?” So in all this, Job said nothing wrong.",
      "When three of Job’s friends heard of the tragedy he had suffered, they got together and traveled from their homes to comfort and console him. Their names were Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite.",
      "When they saw Job from a distance, they scarcely recognized him. Wailing loudly, they tore their robes and threw dust into the air over their heads to show their grief.",
      "Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and nights. No one said a word to Job, for they saw that his suffering was too great for words."

    [
      "At last Job spoke, and he cursed the day of his birth.",
      "He said:",
      "“Let the day of my birth be erased,\n    and the night I was conceived.",
      "Let that day be turned to darkness.\n    Let it be lost even to God on high,\n    and let no light shine on it.",
      "Let the darkness and utter gloom claim that day for its own.\n    Let a black cloud overshadow it,\n    and let the darkness terrify it.",
      "Let that night be blotted off the calendar,\n    never again to be counted among the days of the year,\n    never again to appear among the months.",
      "Let that night be childless.\n    Let it have no joy.",
      "Let those who are experts at cursing—\n    whose cursing could rouse Leviathan—\n    curse that day.",
      "Let its morning stars remain dark.\n    Let it hope for light, but in vain;\n    may it never see the morning light.",
      "Curse that day for failing to shut my mother’s womb,\n    for letting me be born to see all this trouble.",
      "“Why wasn’t I born dead?\n    Why didn’t I die as I came from the womb?",
      "Why was I laid on my mother’s lap?\n    Why did she nurse me at her breasts?",
      "Had I died at birth, I would now be at peace.\n    I would be asleep and at rest.",
      "I would rest with the world’s kings and prime ministers,\n    whose great buildings now lie in ruins.",
      "I would rest with princes, rich in gold,\n    whose palaces were filled with silver.",
      "Why wasn’t I buried like a stillborn child,\n    like a baby who never lives to see the light?",
      "For in death the wicked cause no trouble,\n    and the weary are at rest.",
      "Even captives are at ease in death,\n    with no guards to curse them.",
      "Rich and poor are both there,\n    and the slave is free from his master.",
      "“Oh, why give light to those in misery,\n    and life to those who are bitter?",
      "They long for death, and it won’t come.\n    They search for death more eagerly than for hidden treasure.",
      "They’re filled with joy when they finally die,\n    and rejoice when they find the grave.",
      "Why is life given to those with no future,\n    those God has surrounded with difficulties?",
      "I cannot eat for sighing;\n    my groans pour out like water.",
      "What I always feared has happened to me.\n    What I dreaded has come true.",
      "I have no peace, no quietness.\n    I have no rest; only trouble comes.”"

      "Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied to Job:",

      "Your words have supported those who were falling;\n    you encouraged those with shaky knees.",

      "“Stop and think! Do the innocent die?\n    When have the upright been destroyed?",
      "My experience shows that those who plant trouble\n    and cultivate evil will harvest the same.",
      "A breath from God destroys them.\n    They vanish in a blast of his anger.",
      "The lion roars and the wildcat snarls,\n    but the teeth of strong lions will be broken.",
      "The fierce lion will starve for lack of prey,\n    and the cubs of the lioness will be scattered.",
      "“This truth was given to me in secret,\n    as though whispered in my ear.",
      "It came to me in a disturbing vision at night,\n    when people are in a deep sleep.",
      "Fear gripped me,\n    and my bones trembled.",
      "A spirit swept past my face,\n    and my hair stood on end.",
      "The spirit stopped, but I couldn’t see its shape.\n    There was a form before my eyes.\nIn the silence I heard a voice say,",
      "‘Can a mortal be innocent before God?\n    Can anyone be pure before the Creator?’",

      "“Cry for help, but will anyone answer you?\n    Which of the angels will help you?",

      "Their children are abandoned far from help;\n    they are crushed in court with no one to defend them.",
      "The hungry devour their harvest,\n    even when it is guarded by brambles.\n    The thirsty pant after their wealth.",

      "They find it is dark in the daytime,\n    and they grope at noon as if it were night.",
      "He rescues the poor from the cutting words of the strong,\n    and rescues them from the clutches of the powerful.",
      "And so at last the poor have hope,\n    and the snapping jaws of the wicked are shut.",
      "“But consider the joy of those corrected by God!\n    Do not despise the discipline of the Almighty when you sin.",
      "For though he wounds, he also bandages.\n    He strikes, but his hands also heal.",
      "From six disasters he will rescue you;\n    even in the seventh, he will keep you from evil.",

      "No, it is useless to try to capture it.\n    The hunter who attempts it will be knocked down.",
      "And since no one dares to disturb it,\n    who then can stand up to me?",
      "Who has given me anything that I need to pay back?\n    Everything under heaven is mine.",
      "“I want to emphasize Leviathan’s limbs\n    and its enormous strength and graceful form.",
      "Who can strip off its hide,\n    and who can penetrate its double layer of armor?",
      "Who could pry open its jaws?\n    For its teeth are terrible!",
      "The scales on its back are like rows of shields\n    tightly sealed together.",
      "They are so close together\n    that no air can get between them.",
      "Each scale sticks tight to the next.\n    They interlock and cannot be penetrated.",
      "“When it sneezes, it flashes light!\n    Its eyes are like the red of dawn.",
      "Lightning leaps from its mouth;\n    flames of fire flash out.",
      "Smoke streams from its nostrils\n    like steam from a pot heated over burning rushes.",
      "Its breath would kindle coals,\n    for flames shoot from its mouth.",
      "“The tremendous strength in Leviathan’s neck\n    strikes terror wherever it goes.",
      "Its flesh is hard and firm\n    and cannot be penetrated.",
      "Its heart is hard as rock,\n    hard as a millstone.",
      "When it rises, the mighty are afraid,\n    gripped by terror.",
      "No sword can stop it,\n    no spear, dart, or javelin.",
      "Iron is nothing but straw to that creature,\n    and bronze is like rotten wood.",
      "Arrows cannot make it flee.\n    Stones shot from a sling are like bits of grass.",
      "Clubs are like a blade of grass,\n    and it laughs at the swish of javelins.",
      "Its belly is covered with scales as sharp as glass.\n    It plows up the ground as it drags through the mud.",
      "“Leviathan makes the water boil with its commotion.\n    It stirs the depths like a pot of ointment.",
      "The water glistens in its wake,\n    making the sea look white.",
      "Nothing on earth is its equal,\n    no other creature so fearless.",
      "Of all the creatures, it is the proudest.\n    It is the king of beasts.”"

      "Then Job replied to the Lord:",
      "“I know that you can do anything,\n    and no one can stop you.",
      "You asked, ‘Who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance?’\n    It is I—and I was talking about things I knew nothing about,\n    things far too wonderful for me.",
      "You said, ‘Listen and I will speak!\n    I have some questions for you,\n    and you must answer them.’",
      "I had only heard about you before,\n    but now I have seen you with my own eyes.",
      "I take back everything I said,\n    and I sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance.”",
      "After the Lord had finished speaking to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite: “I am angry with you and your two friends, for you have not spoken accurately about me, as my servant Job has.",
      "So take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer on your behalf. I will not treat you as you deserve, for you have not spoken accurately about me, as my servant Job has.”",
      "So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite did as the Lord commanded them, and the Lord accepted Job’s prayer.",
      "When Job prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his fortunes. In fact, the Lord gave him twice as much as before!",
      "Then all his brothers, sisters, and former friends came and feasted with him in his home. And they consoled him and comforted him because of all the trials the Lord had brought against him. And each of them brought him a gift of money and a gold ring.",
      "So the Lord blessed Job in the second half of his life even more than in the beginning. For now he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 teams of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.",
      "He also gave Job seven more sons and three more daughters.",
      "He named his first daughter Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.",
      "In all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of Job. And their father put them into his will along with their brothers.",
      "Job lived 140 years after that, living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren.",
      "Then he died, an old man who had lived a long, full life."
