      "Many people have set out to write accounts about the events that have been fulfilled among us.",
      "They used the eyewitness reports circulating among us from the early disciples.",
      "Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I also have decided to write an accurate account for you, most honorable Theophilus,",
      "so you can be certain of the truth of everything you were taught.",
      "When Herod was king of Judea, there was a Jewish priest named Zechariah. He was a member of the priestly order of Abijah, and his wife, Elizabeth, was also from the priestly line of Aaron.",
      "Zechariah and Elizabeth were righteous in God’s eyes, careful to obey all of the Lord’s commandments and regulations.",
      "They had no children because Elizabeth was unable to conceive, and they were both very old.",
      "One day Zechariah was serving God in the Temple, for his order was on duty that week.",
      "As was the custom of the priests, he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense.",
      "While the incense was being burned, a great crowd stood outside, praying.",
      "While Zechariah was in the sanctuary, an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the incense altar.",
      "Zechariah was shaken and overwhelmed with fear when he saw him.",
      "But the angel said, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah! God has heard your prayer. Your wife, Elizabeth, will give you a son, and you are to name him John.",
      "You will have great joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,",
      "for he will be great in the eyes of the Lord. He must never touch wine or other alcoholic drinks. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth.",
      "And he will turn many Israelites to the Lord their God.",
      "He will be a man with the spirit and power of Elijah. He will prepare the people for the coming of the Lord. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and he will cause those who are rebellious to accept the wisdom of the godly.”",
      "Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I be sure this will happen? I’m an old man now, and my wife is also well along in years.”",
      "Then the angel said, “I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. It was he who sent me to bring you this good news!",
      "But now, since you didn’t believe what I said, you will be silent and unable to speak until the child is born. For my words will certainly be fulfilled at the proper time.”",
      "Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out of the sanctuary, wondering why he was taking so long.",
      "When he finally did come out, he couldn’t speak to them. Then they realized from his gestures and his silence that he must have seen a vision in the sanctuary.",
      "When Zechariah’s week of service in the Temple was over, he returned home.",
      "Soon afterward his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and went into seclusion for five months.",
      "“How kind the Lord is!” she exclaimed. “He has taken away my disgrace of having no children.”",
      "In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee,",
      "to a virgin named Mary. She was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David.",
      "Gabriel appeared to her and said, “Greetings, favored woman! The Lord is with you!”",
      "Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel could mean.",
      "“Don’t be afraid, Mary,” the angel told her, “for you have found favor with God!",
      "You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.",
      "He will be very great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David.",
      "And he will reign over Israel forever; his Kingdom will never end!”",
      "Mary asked the angel, “But how can this happen? I am a virgin.”",
      "The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the baby to be born will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God.",
      "What’s more, your relative Elizabeth has become pregnant in her old age! People used to say she was barren, but she has conceived a son and is now in her sixth month.",
      "For the word of God will never fail.”",
      "Mary responded, “I am the Lord’s servant. May everything you have said about me come true.” And then the angel left her.",
      "A few days later Mary hurried to the hill country of Judea, to the town",
      "where Zechariah lived. She entered the house and greeted Elizabeth.",
      "At the sound of Mary’s greeting, Elizabeth’s child leaped within her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.",
      "Elizabeth gave a glad cry and exclaimed to Mary, “God has blessed you above all women, and your child is blessed.",
      "Why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should visit me?",
      "When I heard your greeting, the baby in my womb jumped for joy.",
      "You are blessed because you believed that the Lord would do what he said.”",
      "Mary responded,\n“Oh, how my soul praises the Lord.",
      "How my spirit rejoices in God my Savior!",
      "For he took notice of his lowly servant girl,\n    and from now on all generations will call me blessed.",
      "For the Mighty One is holy,\n    and he has done great things for me.",
      "He shows mercy from generation to generation\n    to all who fear him.",
      "His mighty arm has done tremendous things!\n    He has scattered the proud and haughty ones.",
      "He has brought down princes from their thrones\n    and exalted the humble.",
      "He has filled the hungry with good things\n    and sent the rich away with empty hands.",
      "He has helped his servant Israel\n    and remembered to be merciful.",
      "For he made this promise to our ancestors,\n    to Abraham and his children forever.”",
      "Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back to her own home.",
      "When it was time for Elizabeth’s baby to be born, she gave birth to a son.",
      "And when her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very merciful to her, everyone rejoiced with her.",
      "When the baby was eight days old, they all came for the circumcision ceremony. They wanted to name him Zechariah, after his father.",
      "But Elizabeth said, “No! His name is John!”",
      "“What?” they exclaimed. “There is no one in all your family by that name.”",
      "So they used gestures to ask the baby’s father what he wanted to name him.",
      "He motioned for a writing tablet, and to everyone’s surprise he wrote, “His name is John.”",
      "Instantly Zechariah could speak again, and he began praising God.",
      "Awe fell upon the whole neighborhood, and the news of what had happened spread throughout the Judean hills.",
      "Everyone who heard about it reflected on these events and asked, “What will this child turn out to be?” For the hand of the Lord was surely upon him in a special way.",
      "Then his father, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and gave this prophecy:",
      "“Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,\n    because he has visited and redeemed his people.",
      "He has sent us a mighty Savior\n    from the royal line of his servant David,",
      "just as he promised\n    through his holy prophets long ago.",
      "Now we will be saved from our enemies\n    and from all who hate us.",
      "He has been merciful to our ancestors\n    by remembering his sacred covenant—",
      "the covenant he swore with an oath\n    to our ancestor Abraham.",
      "We have been rescued from our enemies\n    so we can serve God without fear,",
      "in holiness and righteousness\n    for as long as we live.",
      "“And you, my little son,\n    will be called the prophet of the Most High,\n    because you will prepare the way for the Lord.",
      "You will tell his people how to find salvation\n    through forgiveness of their sins.",
      "Because of God’s tender mercy,\n    the morning light from heaven is about to break upon us,",
      "to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,\n    and to guide us to the path of peace.”",
      "John grew up and became strong in spirit. And he lived in the wilderness until he began his public ministry to Israel."

      "At that time the Roman emperor, Augustus, decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman Empire.",
      "(This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.)",
      "All returned to their own ancestral towns to register for this census.",
      "And because Joseph was a descendant of King David, he had to go to Bethlehem in Judea, David’s ancient home. He traveled there from the village of Nazareth in Galilee.",
      "He took with him Mary, to whom he was engaged, who was now expecting a child.",
      "And while they were there, the time came for her baby to be born.",
      "She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no lodging available for them.",
      "That night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep.",
      "Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared among them, and the radiance of the Lord’s glory surrounded them. They were terrified,",
      "but the angel reassured them. “Don’t be afraid!” he said. “I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people.",
      "The Savior—yes, the Messiah, the Lord—has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David!",
      "And you will recognize him by this sign: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger.”",
      "Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others—the armies of heaven—praising God and saying,",
      "“Glory to God in highest heaven,\n    and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.”",
      "When the angels had returned to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, “Let’s go to Bethlehem! Let’s see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.”",
      "They hurried to the village and found Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in the manger.",
      "After seeing him, the shepherds told everyone what had happened and what the angel had said to them about this child.",
      "All who heard the shepherds’ story were astonished,",
      "but Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them often.",
      "The shepherds went back to their flocks, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen. It was just as the angel had told them.",
      "Eight days later, when the baby was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel even before he was conceived.",
      "Then it was time for their purification offering, as required by the law of Moses after the birth of a child; so his parents took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.",
      "The law of the Lord says, “If a woman’s first child is a boy, he must be dedicated to the Lord.”",
      "So they offered the sacrifice required in the law of the Lord—“either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”",
      "At that time there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon. He was righteous and devout and was eagerly waiting for the Messiah to come and rescue Israel. The Holy Spirit was upon him",
      "and had revealed to him that he would not die until he had seen the Lord’s Messiah.",
      "That day the Spirit led him to the Temple. So when Mary and Joseph came to present the baby Jesus to the Lord as the law required,",
      "Simeon was there. He took the child in his arms and praised God, saying,",
      "“Sovereign Lord, now let your servant die in peace,\n    as you have promised.",
      "I have seen your salvation,",
      "which you have prepared for all people.",
      "He is a light to reveal God to the nations,\n    and he is the glory of your people Israel!”",
      "Jesus’ parents were amazed at what was being said about him.",
      "Then Simeon blessed them, and he said to Mary, the baby’s mother, “This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall, and many others to rise. He has been sent as a sign from God, but many will oppose him.",
      "As a result, the deepest thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your very soul.”",
      "Anna, a prophet, was also there in the Temple. She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher, and she was very old. Her husband died when they had been married only seven years.",
      "Then she lived as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple but stayed there day and night, worshiping God with fasting and prayer.",
      "She came along just as Simeon was talking with Mary and Joseph, and she began praising God. She talked about the child to everyone who had been waiting expectantly for God to rescue Jerusalem.",
      "When Jesus’ parents had fulfilled all the requirements of the law of the Lord, they returned home to Nazareth in Galilee.",
      "There the child grew up healthy and strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God’s favor was on him.",
      "Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover festival.",
      "When Jesus was twelve years old, they attended the festival as usual.",
      "After the celebration was over, they started home to Nazareth, but Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents didn’t miss him at first,",
      "because they assumed he was among the other travelers. But when he didn’t show up that evening, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends.",
      "When they couldn’t find him, they went back to Jerusalem to search for him there.",
      "Three days later they finally discovered him in the Temple, sitting among the religious teachers, listening to them and asking questions.",
      "All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.",
      "His parents didn’t know what to think. “Son,” his mother said to him, “why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been frantic, searching for you everywhere.”",
      "“But why did you need to search?” he asked. “Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”",
      "But they didn’t understand what he meant.",
      "Then he returned to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. And his mother stored all these things in her heart.",
      "Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and all the people."

      "It was now the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius, the Roman emperor. Pontius Pilate was governor over Judea; Herod Antipas was ruler over Galilee; his brother Philip was ruler over Iturea and Traconitis; Lysanias was ruler over Abilene.",
      "Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. At this time a message from God came to John son of Zechariah, who was living in the wilderness.",
      "Then John went from place to place on both sides of the Jordan River, preaching that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven.",
      "Isaiah had spoken of John when he said,\n“He is a voice shouting in the wilderness,\n‘Prepare the way for the Lord’s coming!\n    Clear the road for him!",

      "And then all people will see\n    the salvation sent from God.’”",
      "When the crowds came to John for baptism, he said, “You brood of snakes! Who warned you to flee the coming wrath?",
      "Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. Don’t just say to each other, ‘We’re safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.’ That means nothing, for I tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these very stones.",
      "Even now the ax of God’s judgment is poised, ready to sever the roots of the trees. Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.”",

      "He replied, “Collect no more taxes than the government requires.”",
      "“What should we do?” asked some soldiers.\nJohn replied, “Don’t extort money or make false accusations. And be content with your pay.”",
      "Everyone was expecting the Messiah to come soon, and they were eager to know whether John might be the Messiah.",
      "John answered their questions by saying, “I baptize you with water; but someone is coming soon who is greater than I am—so much greater that I’m not even worthy to be his slave and untie the straps of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.",
      "He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire.”",
      "John used many such warnings as he announced the Good News to the people.",
      "John also publicly criticized Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee, for marrying Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for many other wrongs he had done.",
      "So Herod put John in prison, adding this sin to his many others.",
      "One day when the crowds were being baptized, Jesus himself was baptized. As he was praying, the heavens opened,",

      "Stepping into one of the boats, Jesus asked Simon, its owner, to push it out into the water. So he sat in the boat and taught the crowds from there.",

      "Jesus reached out and touched him. “I am willing,” he said. “Be healed!” And instantly the leprosy disappeared.",

      "One Sabbath day Jesus went to eat dinner in the home of a leader of the Pharisees, and the people were watching him closely.",
      "There was a man there whose arms and legs were swollen.",
      "Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in religious law, “Is it permitted in the law to heal people on the Sabbath day, or not?”",

      "Then at the resurrection of the righteous, God will reward you for inviting those who could not repay you.”",

      "And when he has found it, he will joyfully carry it home on his shoulders.",
      "When he arrives, he will call together his friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.’",

      "They talked it over among themselves. “If we say it was from heaven, he will ask why we didn’t believe John.",
      "But if we say it was merely human, the people will stone us because they are convinced John was a prophet.”",
      "So they finally replied that they didn’t know.",
      "And Jesus responded, “Then I won’t tell you by what authority I do these things.”",
      "Now Jesus turned to the people again and told them this story: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and moved to another country to live for several years.",
      "At the time of the grape harvest, he sent one of his servants to collect his share of the crop. But the farmers attacked the servant, beat him up, and sent him back empty-handed.",
      "So the owner sent another servant, but they also insulted him, beat him up, and sent him away empty-handed.",
      "A third man was sent, and they wounded him and chased him away.",
      "“‘What will I do?’ the owner asked himself. ‘I know! I’ll send my cherished son. Surely they will respect him.’",
      "“But when the tenant farmers saw his son, they said to each other, ‘Here comes the heir to this estate. Let’s kill him and get the estate for ourselves!’",
      "So they dragged him out of the vineyard and murdered him.\n“What do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do to them?” Jesus asked.",
      "“I’ll tell you—he will come and kill those farmers and lease the vineyard to others.”\n“How terrible that such a thing should ever happen,” his listeners protested.",
      "Jesus looked at them and said, “Then what does this Scripture mean?\n‘The stone that the builders rejected\n    has now become the cornerstone.’",
      "Everyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone it falls on.”",
      "The teachers of religious law and the leading priests wanted to arrest Jesus immediately because they realized he was telling the story against them—they were the wicked farmers. But they were afraid of the people’s reaction.",
      "Watching for their opportunity, the leaders sent spies pretending to be honest men. They tried to get Jesus to say something that could be reported to the Roman governor so he would arrest Jesus.",
      "“Teacher,” they said, “we know that you speak and teach what is right and are not influenced by what others think. You teach the way of God truthfully.",
      "Now tell us—is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”",
      "He saw through their trickery and said,",
      "“Show me a Roman coin. Whose picture and title are stamped on it?”\n“Caesar’s,” they replied.",
      "“Well then,” he said, “give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God.”",
      "So they failed to trap him by what he said in front of the people. Instead, they were amazed by his answer, and they became silent.",
      "Then Jesus was approached by some Sadducees—religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead.",
      "They posed this question: “Teacher, Moses gave us a law that if a man dies, leaving a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother’s name.",
      "Well, suppose there were seven brothers. The oldest one married and then died without children.",
      "So the second brother married the widow, but he also died.",
      "Then the third brother married her. This continued with all seven of them, who died without children.",
      "Finally, the woman also died.",
      "So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection? For all seven were married to her!”",
      "Jesus replied, “Marriage is for people here on earth.",
      "But in the age to come, those worthy of being raised from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage.",
      "And they will never die again. In this respect they will be like angels. They are children of God and children of the resurrection.",
      "“But now, as to whether the dead will be raised—even Moses proved this when he wrote about the burning bush. Long after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had died, he referred to the Lord as ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’",
      "So he is the God of the living, not the dead, for they are all alive to him.”",
      "“Well said, Teacher!” remarked some of the teachers of religious law who were standing there.",
      "And then no one dared to ask him any more questions.",
      "Then Jesus presented them with a question. “Why is it,” he asked, “that the Messiah is said to be the son of David?",
      "For David himself wrote in the book of Psalms:\n‘The Lord said to my Lord,\n    Sit in the place of honor at my right hand",
      "until I humble your enemies,\n    making them a footstool under your feet.’",
      "Since David called the Messiah ‘Lord,’ how can the Messiah be his son?”",
      "Then, with the crowds listening, he turned to his disciples and said,",
      "“Beware of these teachers of religious law! For they like to parade around in flowing robes and love to receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces. And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets.",
      "Yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this, they will be severely punished.”"

      "Then a poor widow came by and dropped in two small coins.",
      "“I tell you the truth,” Jesus said, “this poor widow has given more than all the rest of them.",
      "For they have given a tiny part of their surplus, but she, poor as she is, has given everything she has.”",
      "Some of his disciples began talking about the majestic stonework of the Temple and the memorial decorations on the walls. But Jesus said,",

      "As he spoke, he showed them his hands and his feet.",
      "Still they stood there in disbelief, filled with joy and wonder. Then he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”",
      "They gave him a piece of broiled fish,",
      "and he ate it as they watched.",
      "Then he said, “When I was with you before, I told you that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms must be fulfilled.”",
      "Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.",
      "And he said, “Yes, it was written long ago that the Messiah would suffer and die and rise from the dead on the third day.",
      "It was also written that this message would be proclaimed in the authority of his name to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem: ‘There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.’",
      "You are witnesses of all these things.",
      "“And now I will send the Holy Spirit, just as my Father promised. But stay here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven.”",
      "Then Jesus led them to Bethany, and lifting his hands to heaven, he blessed them.",
      "While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up to heaven.",
      "So they worshiped him and then returned to Jerusalem filled with great joy.",
      "And they spent all of their time in the Temple, praising God."
