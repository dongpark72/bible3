      "Solomon son of David took firm control of his kingdom, for the Lord his God was with him and made him very powerful.",
      "Solomon called together all the leaders of Israel—the generals and captains of the army, the judges, and all the political and clan leaders.",
      "Then he led the entire assembly to the place of worship in Gibeon, for God’s Tabernacle was located there. (This was the Tabernacle that Moses, the Lord’s servant, had made in the wilderness.)",
      "David had already moved the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the tent he had prepared for it in Jerusalem.",
      "But the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri and grandson of Hur was there at Gibeon in front of the Tabernacle of the Lord. So Solomon and the people gathered in front of it to consult the Lord.",
      "There in front of the Tabernacle, Solomon went up to the bronze altar in the Lord’s presence and sacrificed 1,000 burnt offerings on it.",
      "That night God appeared to Solomon and said, “What do you want? Ask, and I will give it to you!”",
      "Solomon replied to God, “You showed great and faithful love to David, my father, and now you have made me king in his place.",
      "O Lord God, please continue to keep your promise to David my father, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth!",
      "Give me the wisdom and knowledge to lead them properly, for who could possibly govern this great people of yours?”",
      "God said to Solomon, “Because your greatest desire is to help your people, and you did not ask for wealth, riches, fame, or even the death of your enemies or a long life, but rather you asked for wisdom and knowledge to properly govern my people—",
      "I will certainly give you the wisdom and knowledge you requested. But I will also give you wealth, riches, and fame such as no other king has had before you or will ever have in the future!”",
      "Then Solomon returned to Jerusalem from the Tabernacle at the place of worship in Gibeon, and he reigned over Israel.",
      "Solomon built up a huge force of chariots and horses. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses. He stationed some of them in the chariot cities and some near him in Jerusalem.",
      "The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah.",
      "Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Cilicia; the king’s traders acquired them from Cilicia at the standard price.",
      "At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver, and horses for 150 pieces of silver. They were then exported to the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram."

      "Solomon decided to build a Temple to honor the name of the Lord, and also a royal palace for himself.",
      "He enlisted a force of 70,000 laborers, 80,000 men to quarry stone in the hill country, and 3,600 foremen.",
      "Solomon also sent this message to King Hiram at Tyre:\n“Send me cedar logs as you did for my father, David, when he was building his palace.",
      "I am about to build a Temple to honor the name of the Lord my God. It will be a place set apart to burn fragrant incense before him, to display the special sacrificial bread, and to sacrifice burnt offerings each morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, at new moon celebrations, and at the other appointed festivals of the Lord our God. He has commanded Israel to do these things forever.",
      "“This must be a magnificent Temple because our God is greater than all other gods.",
      "But who can really build him a worthy home? Not even the highest heavens can contain him! So who am I to consider building a Temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices to him?",
      "“So send me a master craftsman who can work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, as well as with purple, scarlet, and blue cloth. He must be a skilled engraver who can work with the craftsmen of Judah and Jerusalem who were selected by my father, David.",
      "“Also send me cedar, cypress, and red sandalwood logs from Lebanon, for I know that your men are without equal at cutting timber in Lebanon. I will send my men to help them.",
      "An immense amount of timber will be needed, for the Temple I am going to build will be very large and magnificent.",
      "In payment for your woodcutters, I will send 100,000 bushels of crushed wheat, 100,000 bushels of barley, 110,000 gallons of wine, and 110,000 gallons of olive oil.”",
      "King Hiram sent this letter of reply to Solomon:\n“It is because the Lord loves his people that he has made you their king!",
      "Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth! He has given King David a wise son, gifted with skill and understanding, who will build a Temple for the Lord and a royal palace for himself.",
      "“I am sending you a master craftsman named Huram-abi, who is extremely talented.",
      "His mother is from the tribe of Dan in Israel, and his father is from Tyre. He is skillful at making things from gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and he also works with stone and wood. He can work with purple, blue, and scarlet cloth and fine linen. He is also an engraver and can follow any design given to him. He will work with your craftsmen and those appointed by my lord David, your father.",
      "“Send along the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine that my lord has mentioned.",
      "We will cut whatever timber you need from the Lebanon mountains and will float the logs in rafts down the coast of the Mediterranean Sea to Joppa. From there you can transport the logs up to Jerusalem.”",
      "Solomon took a census of all foreigners in the land of Israel, like the census his father had taken, and he counted 153,600.",
      "He assigned 70,000 of them as common laborers, 80,000 as quarry workers in the hill country, and 3,600 as foremen."

      "So Solomon began to build the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the Lord had appeared to David, his father. The Temple was built on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, the site that David had selected.",
      "The construction began in midspring, during the fourth year of Solomon’s reign.",
      "These are the dimensions Solomon used for the foundation of the Temple of God (using the old standard of measurement). It was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide.",
      "The entry room at the front of the Temple was 30 feet wide, running across the entire width of the Temple, and 30 feet high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.",
      "He paneled the main room of the Temple with cypress wood, overlaid it with fine gold, and decorated it with carvings of palm trees and chains.",
      "He decorated the walls of the Temple with beautiful jewels and with gold from the land of Parvaim.",
      "He overlaid the beams, thresholds, walls, and doors throughout the Temple with gold, and he carved figures of cherubim on the walls.",
      "He made the Most Holy Place 30 feet wide, corresponding to the width of the Temple, and 30 feet deep. He overlaid its interior with 23 tons of fine gold.",
      "The gold nails that were used weighed 20 ounces each. He also overlaid the walls of the upper rooms with gold.",
      "He made two figures shaped like cherubim, overlaid them with gold, and placed them in the Most Holy Place.",
      "The total wingspan of the two cherubim standing side by side was 30 feet. One wing of the first figure was 7 1⁄2 feet long, and it touched the Temple wall. The other wing, also 7 1⁄2 feet long, touched one of the wings of the second figure.",
      "In the same way, the second figure had one wing 7 1⁄2 feet long that touched the opposite wall. The other wing, also 7 1⁄2 feet long, touched the wing of the first figure.",
      "So the wingspan of the two cherubim side by side was 30 feet. They stood on their feet and faced out toward the main room of the Temple.",
      "Across the entrance of the Most Holy Place he hung a curtain made of fine linen, decorated with blue, purple, and scarlet thread and embroidered with figures of cherubim.",
      "For the front of the Temple, he made two pillars that were 27 feet tall, each topped by a capital extending upward another 7 1⁄2 feet.",
      "He made a network of interwoven chains and used them to decorate the tops of the pillars. He also made 100 decorative pomegranates and attached them to the chains.",
      "Then he set up the two pillars at the entrance of the Temple, one to the south of the entrance and the other to the north. He named the one on the south Jakin, and the one on the north Boaz."

    [
      "Solomon also made a bronze altar 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 15 feet high.",
      "Then he cast a great round basin, 15 feet across from rim to rim, called the Sea. It was 7 1⁄2 feet deep and about 45 feet in circumference.",
      "It was encircled just below its rim by two rows of figures that resembled oxen. There were about six oxen per foot all the way around, and they were cast as part of the basin.",
      "The Sea was placed on a base of twelve bronze oxen, all facing outward. Three faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east, and the Sea rested on them.",
      "The walls of the Sea were about three inches thick, and its rim flared out like a cup and resembled a water lily blossom. It could hold about 16,500 gallons of water.",
      "He also made ten smaller basins for washing the utensils for the burnt offerings. He set five on the south side and five on the north. But the priests washed themselves in the Sea.",
      "He then cast ten gold lampstands according to the specifications that had been given, and he put them in the Temple. Five were placed against the south wall, and five were placed against the north wall.",
      "He also built ten tables and placed them in the Temple, five along the south wall and five along the north wall. Then he molded 100 gold basins.",
      "He then built a courtyard for the priests, and also the large outer courtyard. He made doors for the courtyard entrances and overlaid them with bronze.",
      "The great bronze basin called the Sea was placed near the southeast corner of the Temple.",
      "Huram-abi also made the necessary washbasins, shovels, and bowls.\nSo at last Huram-abi completed everything King Solomon had assigned him to make for the Temple of God:",
      "the two pillars;\nthe two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;\nthe two networks of interwoven chains that decorated the capitals;",
      "the 400 pomegranates that hung from the chains on the capitals (two rows of pomegranates for each of the chain networks that decorated the capitals on top of the pillars);",
      "the water carts holding the basins;",
      "the Sea and the twelve oxen under it;",
      "the ash buckets, the shovels, the meat hooks, and all the related articles.\nHuram-abi made all these things of burnished bronze for the Temple of the Lord, just as King Solomon had directed.",
      "The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zarethan.",
      "Solomon used such great quantities of bronze that its weight could not be determined.",
      "Solomon also made all the furnishings for the Temple of God:\nthe gold altar;\nthe tables for the Bread of the Presence;",
      "the lampstands and their lamps of solid gold, to burn in front of the Most Holy Place as prescribed;",
      "the flower decorations, lamps, and tongs—all of the purest gold;",
      "the lamp snuffers, bowls, ladles, and incense burners—all of solid gold;\nthe doors for the entrances to the Most Holy Place and the main room of the Temple, overlaid with gold."

      "So Solomon finished all his work on the Temple of the Lord. Then he brought all the gifts his father, David, had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and the various articles—and he stored them in the treasuries of the Temple of God.",
      "Solomon then summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel and all the heads of tribes—the leaders of the ancestral families of Israel. They were to bring the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant to the Temple from its location in the City of David, also known as Zion.",
      "So all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the annual Festival of Shelters, which is held in early autumn.",
      "When all the elders of Israel arrived, the Levites picked up the Ark.",
      "The priests and Levites brought up the Ark along with the special tent and all the sacred items that had been in it.",
      "There, before the Ark, King Solomon and the entire community of Israel sacrificed so many sheep, goats, and cattle that no one could keep count!",
      "Then the priests carried the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant into the inner sanctuary of the Temple—the Most Holy Place—and placed it beneath the wings of the cherubim.",
      "The cherubim spread their wings over the Ark, forming a canopy over the Ark and its carrying poles.",
      "These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place, which is in front of the Most Holy Place, but not from the outside. They are still there to this day.",
      "Nothing was in the Ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Mount Sinai, where the Lord made a covenant with the people of Israel when they left Egypt.",
      "Then the priests left the Holy Place. All the priests who were present had purified themselves, whether or not they were on duty that day.",
      "And the Levites who were musicians—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and all their sons and brothers—were dressed in fine linen robes and stood at the east side of the altar playing cymbals, lyres, and harps. They were joined by 120 priests who were playing trumpets.",
      "The trumpeters and singers performed together in unison to praise and give thanks to the Lord. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments, they raised their voices and praised the Lord with these words:\n“He is good!\n    His faithful love endures forever!”\nAt that moment a thick cloud filled the Temple of the Lord.",
      "The priests could not continue their service because of the cloud, for the glorious presence of the Lord filled the Temple of God."
    ],
    [
      "Then Solomon prayed, “O Lord, you have said that you would live in a thick cloud of darkness.",
      "Now I have built a glorious Temple for you, a place where you can live forever!”",
      "Then the king turned around to the entire community of Israel standing before him and gave this blessing:",
      "“Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, who has kept the promise he made to my father, David. For he told my father,",
      "‘From the day I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I have never chosen a city among any of the tribes of Israel as the place where a Temple should be built to honor my name. Nor have I chosen a king to lead my people Israel.",
      "But now I have chosen Jerusalem as the place for my name to be honored, and I have chosen David to be king over my people Israel.’”",
      "Then Solomon said, “My father, David, wanted to build this Temple to honor the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.",
      "But the Lord told him, ‘You wanted to build the Temple to honor my name. Your intention is good,",
      "but you are not the one to do it. One of your own sons will build the Temple to honor me.’",
      "“And now the Lord has fulfilled the promise he made, for I have become king in my father’s place, and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the Lord promised. I have built this Temple to honor the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.",
      "There I have placed the Ark, which contains the covenant that the Lord made with the people of Israel.”",
      "Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in front of the entire community of Israel, and he lifted his hands in prayer.",
      "Now Solomon had made a bronze platform 7 1⁄2 feet long, 7 1⁄2 feet wide, and 4 1⁄2 feet high and had placed it at the center of the Temple’s outer courtyard. He stood on the platform, and then he knelt in front of the entire community of Israel and lifted his hands toward heaven.",
      "He prayed,\n“O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like you in all of heaven and earth. You keep your covenant and show unfailing love to all who walk before you in wholehearted devotion.",
      "You have kept your promise to your servant David, my father. You made that promise with your own mouth, and with your own hands you have fulfilled it today.",
      "“And now, O Lord, God of Israel, carry out the additional promise you made to your servant David, my father. For you said to him, ‘If your descendants guard their behavior and faithfully follow my Law as you have done, one of them will always sit on the throne of Israel.’",
      "Now, O Lord, God of Israel, fulfill this promise to your servant David.",
      "“But will God really live on earth among people? Why, even the highest heavens cannot contain you. How much less this Temple I have built!",
      "Nevertheless, listen to my prayer and my plea, O Lord my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is making to you.",
      "May you watch over this Temple day and night, this place where you have said you would put your name. May you always hear the prayers I make toward this place.",
      "May you hear the humble and earnest requests from me and your people Israel when we pray toward this place. Yes, hear us from heaven where you live, and when you hear, forgive.",
      "“If someone wrongs another person and is required to take an oath of innocence in front of your altar at this Temple,",
      "then hear from heaven and judge between your servants—the accuser and the accused. Pay back the guilty as they deserve. Acquit the innocent because of their innocence.",
      "“If your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against you, and if they turn back and acknowledge your name and pray to you here in this Temple,",
      "then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and return them to this land you gave to them and to their ancestors.",
      "“If the skies are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and if they pray toward this Temple and acknowledge your name and turn from their sins because you have punished them,",
      "then hear from heaven and forgive the sins of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them to follow the right path, and send rain on your land that you have given to your people as their special possession.",
      "“If there is a famine in the land or a plague or crop disease or attacks of locusts or caterpillars, or if your people’s enemies are in the land besieging their towns—whatever disaster or disease there is—",
      "and if your people Israel pray about their troubles or sorrow, raising their hands toward this Temple,",
      "then hear from heaven where you live, and forgive. Give your people what their actions deserve, for you alone know each human heart.",
      "Then they will fear you and walk in your ways as long as they live in the land you gave to our ancestors.",
      "“In the future, foreigners who do not belong to your people Israel will hear of you. They will come from distant lands when they hear of your great name and your strong hand and your powerful arm. And when they pray toward this Temple,",
      "then hear from heaven where you live, and grant what they ask of you. In this way, all the people of the earth will come to know and fear you, just as your own people Israel do. They, too, will know that this Temple I have built honors your name.",
      "“If your people go out where you send them to fight their enemies, and if they pray to you by turning toward this city you have chosen and toward this Temple I have built to honor your name,",
      "then hear their prayers from heaven and uphold their cause.",
      "“If they sin against you—and who has never sinned?—you might become angry with them and let their enemies conquer them and take them captive to a foreign land far away or near.",
      "But in that land of exile, they might turn to you in repentance and pray, ‘We have sinned, done evil, and acted wickedly.’",
      "If they turn to you with their whole heart and soul in the land of their captivity and pray toward the land you gave to their ancestors—toward this city you have chosen, and toward this Temple I have built to honor your name—",
      "then hear their prayers and their petitions from heaven where you live, and uphold their cause. Forgive your people who have sinned against you.",
      "“O my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to all the prayers made to you in this place.",
      "“And now arise, O Lord God, and enter your resting place,\n    along with the Ark, the symbol of your power.\nMay your priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation;\n    may your loyal servants rejoice in your goodness.",
      "O Lord God, do not reject the king you have anointed.\n    Remember your unfailing love for your servant David.”"

      "When Solomon finished praying, fire flashed down from heaven and burned up the burnt offerings and sacrifices, and the glorious presence of the Lord filled the Temple.",
      "The priests could not enter the Temple of the Lord because the glorious presence of the Lord filled it.",
      "When all the people of Israel saw the fire coming down and the glorious presence of the Lord filling the Temple, they fell face down on the ground and worshiped and praised the Lord, saying,\n“He is good!\n    His faithful love endures forever!”",
      "Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices to the Lord.",
      "King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep and goats. And so the king and all the people dedicated the Temple of God.",
      "The priests took their assigned positions, and so did the Levites who were singing, “His faithful love endures forever!” They accompanied the singing with music from the instruments King David had made for praising the Lord. Across from the Levites, the priests blew the trumpets, while all Israel stood.",
      "Solomon then consecrated the central area of the courtyard in front of the Lord’s Temple. He offered burnt offerings and the fat of peace offerings there, because the bronze altar he had built could not hold all the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and sacrificial fat.",
      "For the next seven days Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters. A large congregation had gathered from as far away as Lebo-hamath in the north and the Brook of Egypt in the south.",
      "On the eighth day they had a closing ceremony, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the Festival of Shelters for seven days.",
      "Then at the end of the celebration, Solomon sent the people home. They were all joyful and glad because the Lord had been so good to David and to Solomon and to his people Israel.",
      "So Solomon finished the Temple of the Lord, as well as the royal palace. He completed everything he had planned to do in the construction of the Temple and the palace.",
      "Then one night the Lord appeared to Solomon and said,\n“I have heard your prayer and have chosen this Temple as the place for making sacrifices.",
      "At times I might shut up the heavens so that no rain falls, or command grasshoppers to devour your crops, or send plagues among you.",
      "Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land.",
      "My eyes will be open and my ears attentive to every prayer made in this place.",
      "For I have chosen this Temple and set it apart to be holy—a place where my name will be honored forever. I will always watch over it, for it is dear to my heart.",
      "“As for you, if you faithfully follow me as David your father did, obeying all my commands, decrees, and regulations,",
      "then I will establish the throne of your dynasty. For I made this covenant with your father, David, when I said, ‘One of your descendants will always rule over Israel.’",
      "“But if you or your descendants abandon me and disobey the decrees and commands I have given you, and if you serve and worship other gods,",
      "then I will uproot the people from this land that I have given them. I will reject this Temple that I have made holy to honor my name. I will make it an object of mockery and ridicule among the nations.",
      "And though this Temple is impressive now, all who pass by will be appalled. They will ask, ‘Why did the Lord do such terrible things to this land and to this Temple?’",
      "“And the answer will be, ‘Because his people abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors, who brought them out of Egypt, and they worshiped other gods instead and bowed down to them. That is why he has brought all these disasters on them.’”"

      "It took Solomon twenty years to build the Lord’s Temple and his own royal palace. At the end of that time,",
      "Solomon turned his attention to rebuilding the towns that King Hiram had given him, and he settled Israelites in them.",
      "Solomon also fought against the town of Hamath-zobah and conquered it.",
      "He rebuilt Tadmor in the wilderness and built towns in the region of Hamath as supply centers.",
      "He fortified the towns of Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, rebuilding their walls and installing barred gates.",
      "He also rebuilt Baalath and other supply centers and constructed towns where his chariots and horses could be stationed. He built everything he desired in Jerusalem and Lebanon and throughout his entire realm.",
      "There were still some people living in the land who were not Israelites, including the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.",
      "These were descendants of the nations whom the people of Israel had not destroyed. So Solomon conscripted them for his labor force, and they serve as forced laborers to this day.",
      "But Solomon did not conscript any of the Israelites for his labor force. Instead, he assigned them to serve as fighting men, officers in his army, commanders of his chariots, and charioteers.",
      "King Solomon appointed 250 of them to supervise the people.",
      "Solomon moved his wife, Pharaoh’s daughter, from the City of David to the new palace he had built for her. He said, “My wife must not live in King David’s palace, for the Ark of the Lord has been there, and it is holy ground.”",
      "Then Solomon presented burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar he had built for him in front of the entry room of the Temple.",
      "He offered the sacrifices for the Sabbaths, the new moon festivals, and the three annual festivals—the Passover celebration, the Festival of Harvest, and the Festival of Shelters—as Moses had commanded.",
      "In assigning the priests to their duties, Solomon followed the regulations of his father, David. He also assigned the Levites to lead the people in praise and to assist the priests in their daily duties. And he assigned the gatekeepers to their gates by their divisions, following the commands of David, the man of God.",
      "Solomon did not deviate in any way from David’s commands concerning the priests and Levites and the treasuries.",
      "So Solomon made sure that all the work related to building the Temple of the Lord was carried out, from the day its foundation was laid to the day of its completion.",
      "Later Solomon went to Ezion-geber and Elath, ports along the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom.",
      "Hiram sent him ships commanded by his own officers and manned by experienced crews of sailors. These ships sailed to Ophir with Solomon’s men and brought back to Solomon almost seventeen tons of gold."

      "When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She arrived with a large group of attendants and a great caravan of camels loaded with spices, large quantities of gold, and precious jewels. When she met with Solomon, she talked with him about everything she had on her mind.",
      "Solomon had answers for all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her.",
      "When the queen of Sheba realized how wise Solomon was, and when she saw the palace he had built,",
      "she was overwhelmed. She was also amazed at the food on his tables, the organization of his officials and their splendid clothing, the cup-bearers and their robes, and the burnt offerings Solomon made at the Temple of the Lord.",
      "She exclaimed to the king, “Everything I heard in my country about your achievements and wisdom is true!",
      "I didn’t believe what was said until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes. In fact, I had not heard the half of your great wisdom! It is far beyond what I was told.",
      "How happy your people must be! What a privilege for your officials to stand here day after day, listening to your wisdom!",
      "Praise the Lord your God, who delights in you and has placed you on the throne as king to rule for him. Because God loves Israel and desires this kingdom to last forever, he has made you king over them so you can rule with justice and righteousness.”",
      "Then she gave the king a gift of 9,000 pounds of gold, great quantities of spices, and precious jewels. Never before had there been spices as fine as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.",
      "(In addition, the crews of Hiram and Solomon brought gold from Ophir, and they also brought red sandalwood and precious jewels.",
      "The king used the sandalwood to make steps for the Temple of the Lord and the royal palace, and to construct lyres and harps for the musicians. Never before had such beautiful things been seen in Judah.)",
      "King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba whatever she asked for—gifts of greater value than the gifts she had given him. Then she and all her attendants returned to their own land.",
      "Each year Solomon received about 25 tons of gold.",
      "This did not include the additional revenue he received from merchants and traders. All the kings of Arabia and the governors of the provinces also brought gold and silver to Solomon.",
      "King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold, each weighing more than 15 pounds.",

      "Manasseh also sacrificed his own sons in the fire in the valley of Ben-Hinnom. He practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and he consulted with mediums and psychics. He did much that was evil in the Lord’s sight, arousing his anger.",
      "Manasseh even took a carved idol he had made and set it up in God’s Temple, the very place where God had told David and his son Solomon: “My name will be honored forever in this Temple and in Jerusalem—the city I have chosen from among all the tribes of Israel.",
      "If the Israelites will be careful to obey my commands—all the laws, decrees, and regulations given through Moses—I will not send them into exile from this land that I set aside for your ancestors.”",
      "But Manasseh led the people of Judah and Jerusalem to do even more evil than the pagan nations that the Lord had destroyed when the people of Israel entered the land.",
      "The Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they ignored all his warnings.",
      "So the Lord sent the commanders of the Assyrian armies, and they took Manasseh prisoner. They put a ring through his nose, bound him in bronze chains, and led him away to Babylon.",
      "But while in deep distress, Manasseh sought the Lord his God and sincerely humbled himself before the God of his ancestors.",
      "And when he prayed, the Lord listened to him and was moved by his request. So the Lord brought Manasseh back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh finally realized that the Lord alone is God!",
      "After this Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, from west of the Gihon Spring in the Kidron Valley to the Fish Gate, and continuing around the hill of Ophel. He built the wall very high. And he stationed his military officers in all of the fortified towns of Judah.",
      "Manasseh also removed the foreign gods and the idol from the Lord’s Temple. He tore down all the altars he had built on the hill where the Temple stood and all the altars that were in Jerusalem, and he dumped them outside the city.",
      "Then he restored the altar of the Lord and sacrificed peace offerings and thanksgiving offerings on it. He also encouraged the people of Judah to worship the Lord, the God of Israel.",
      "However, the people still sacrificed at the pagan shrines, though only to the Lord their God.",
      "The rest of the events of Manasseh’s reign, his prayer to God, and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel.",
      "Manasseh’s prayer, the account of the way God answered him, and an account of all his sins and unfaithfulness are recorded in The Record of the Seers. It includes a list of the locations where he built pagan shrines and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself and repented.",
      "When Manasseh died, he was buried in his palace. Then his son Amon became the next king.",
      "Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years.",
      "He did what was evil in the Lord’s sight, just as his father, Manasseh, had done. He worshiped and sacrificed to all the idols his father had made.",
      "But unlike his father, he did not humble himself before the Lord. Instead, Amon sinned even more.",
      "Then Amon’s own officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace.",
      "But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah the next king."

      "During the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, Josiah began to seek the God of his ancestor David. Then in the twelfth year he began to purify Judah and Jerusalem, destroying all the pagan shrines, the Asherah poles, and the carved idols and cast images.",
      "He ordered that the altars of Baal be demolished and that the incense altars which stood above them be broken down. He also made sure that the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast images were smashed and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.",
      "He burned the bones of the pagan priests on their own altars, and so he purified Judah and Jerusalem.",
      "He did the same thing in the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, even as far as Naphtali, and in the regions all around them.",
      "He destroyed the pagan altars and the Asherah poles, and he crushed the idols into dust. He cut down all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel. Finally, he returned to Jerusalem.",
      "In the eighteenth year of his reign, after he had purified the land and the Temple, Josiah appointed Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of Jerusalem, and Joah son of Joahaz, the royal historian, to repair the Temple of the Lord his God.",
      "They gave Hilkiah the high priest the money that had been collected by the Levites who served as gatekeepers at the Temple of God. The gifts were brought by people from Manasseh, Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, as well as from all Judah, Benjamin, and the people of Jerusalem.",
      "He entrusted the money to the men assigned to supervise the restoration of the Lord’s Temple. Then they paid the workers who did the repairs and renovation of the Temple.",
      "They hired carpenters and builders, who purchased finished stone for the walls and timber for the rafters and beams. They restored what earlier kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.",
      "The workers served faithfully under the leadership of Jahath and Obadiah, Levites of the Merarite clan, and Zechariah and Meshullam, Levites of the Kohathite clan. Other Levites, all of whom were skilled musicians,",
      "were put in charge of the laborers of the various trades. Still others assisted as secretaries, officials, and gatekeepers.",
      "While they were bringing out the money collected at the Lord’s Temple, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the Lord that was written by Moses.",
      "Hilkiah said to Shaphan the court secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the Lord’s Temple!” Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan.",
      "Shaphan took the scroll to the king and reported, “Your officials are doing everything they were assigned to do.",
      "The money that was collected at the Temple of the Lord has been turned over to the supervisors and workmen.”",
      "Shaphan also told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll.” So Shaphan read it to the king.",
      "When the king heard what was written in the Law, he tore his clothes in despair.",
      "Then he gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the court secretary, and Asaiah the king’s personal adviser:",
      "“Go to the Temple and speak to the Lord for me and for all the remnant of Israel and Judah. Inquire about the words written in the scroll that has been found. For the Lord’s great anger has been poured out on us because our ancestors have not obeyed the word of the Lord. We have not been doing everything this scroll says we must do.”",
      "So Hilkiah and the other men went to the New Quarter of Jerusalem to consult with the prophet Huldah. She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, the keeper of the Temple wardrobe.",
      "She said to them, “The Lord, the God of Israel, has spoken! Go back and tell the man who sent you,",
      "‘This is what the Lord says: I am going to bring disaster on this city and its people. All the curses written in the scroll that was read to the king of Judah will come true.",
      "For my people have abandoned me and offered sacrifices to pagan gods, and I am very angry with them for everything they have done. My anger will be poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.’",
      "“But go to the king of Judah who sent you to seek the Lord and tell him: ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says concerning the message you have just heard:",
      "You were sorry and humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this city and its people. You humbled yourself and tore your clothing in despair and wept before me in repentance. And I have indeed heard you, says the Lord.",
      "So I will not send the promised disaster until after you have died and been buried in peace. You yourself will not see the disaster I am going to bring on this city and its people.’”\nSo they took her message back to the king.",
      "Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.",
      "And the king went up to the Temple of the Lord with all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, along with the priests and the Levites—all the people from the greatest to the least. There the king read to them the entire Book of the Covenant that had been found in the Lord’s Temple.",
      "The king took his place of authority beside the pillar and renewed the covenant in the Lord’s presence. He pledged to obey the Lord by keeping all his commands, laws, and decrees with all his heart and soul. He promised to obey all the terms of the covenant that were written in the scroll.",
      "And he required everyone in Jerusalem and the people of Benjamin to make a similar pledge. The people of Jerusalem did so, renewing their covenant with God, the God of their ancestors.",
      "So Josiah removed all detestable idols from the entire land of Israel and required everyone to worship the Lord their God. And throughout the rest of his lifetime, they did not turn away from the Lord, the God of their ancestors."

      "Then Josiah announced that the Passover of the Lord would be celebrated in Jerusalem, and so the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month.",
      "Josiah also assigned the priests to their duties and encouraged them in their work at the Temple of the Lord.",
      "He issued this order to the Levites, who were to teach all Israel and who had been set apart to serve the Lord: “Put the holy Ark in the Temple that was built by Solomon son of David, the king of Israel. You no longer need to carry it back and forth on your shoulders. Now spend your time serving the Lord your God and his people Israel.",
      "Report for duty according to the family divisions of your ancestors, following the directions of King David of Israel and the directions of his son Solomon.",

      "The king’s officials also made willing contributions to the people, priests, and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the administrators of God’s Temple, gave the priests 2,600 lambs and young goats and 300 cattle as Passover offerings.",
      "The Levite leaders—Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad—gave 5,000 lambs and young goats and 500 cattle to the Levites for their Passover offerings.",
      "When everything was ready for the Passover celebration, the priests and the Levites took their places, organized by their divisions, as the king had commanded.",

      "They divided the burnt offerings among the people by their family groups, so they could offer them to the Lord as prescribed in the Book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle.",
      "Then they roasted the Passover lambs as prescribed; and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, kettles, and pans, and brought them out quickly so the people could eat them.",
      "Afterward the Levites prepared Passover offerings for themselves and for the priests—the descendants of Aaron—because the priests had been busy from morning till night offering the burnt offerings and the fat portions. The Levites took responsibility for all these preparations.",
      "The musicians, descendants of Asaph, were in their assigned places, following the commands that had been given by David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king’s seer. The gatekeepers guarded the gates and did not need to leave their posts of duty, for their Passover offerings were prepared for them by their fellow Levites.",
      "The entire ceremony for the Lord’s Passover was completed that day. All the burnt offerings were sacrificed on the altar of the Lord, as King Josiah had commanded.",
      "All the Israelites present in Jerusalem celebrated Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.",
      "Never since the time of the prophet Samuel had there been such a Passover. None of the kings of Israel had ever kept a Passover as Josiah did, involving all the priests and Levites, all the people of Jerusalem, and people from all over Judah and Israel.",

      "After Josiah had finished restoring the Temple, King Neco of Egypt led his army up from Egypt to do battle at Carchemish on the Euphrates River, and Josiah and his army marched out to fight him.",

      "But Josiah refused to listen to Neco, to whom God had indeed spoken, and he would not turn back. Instead, he disguised himself and led his army into battle on the plain of Megiddo.",
      "But the enemy archers hit King Josiah with their arrows and wounded him. He cried out to his men, “Take me from the battle, for I am badly wounded!”",
      "So they lifted Josiah out of his chariot and placed him in another chariot. Then they brought him back to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried there in the royal cemetery. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.",
      "The prophet Jeremiah composed funeral songs for Josiah, and to this day choirs still sing these sad songs about his death. These songs of sorrow have become a tradition and are recorded in The Book of Laments.",

      "Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.",
      "But Zedekiah did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God, and he refused to humble himself when the prophet Jeremiah spoke to him directly from the Lord.",
      "He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, even though he had taken an oath of loyalty in God’s name. Zedekiah was a hard and stubborn man, refusing to turn to the Lord, the God of Israel.",
      "Likewise, all the leaders of the priests and the people became more and more unfaithful. They followed all the pagan practices of the surrounding nations, desecrating the Temple of the Lord that had been consecrated in Jerusalem.",

      "So the Lord brought the king of Babylon against them. The Babylonians killed Judah’s young men, even chasing after them into the Temple. They had no pity on the people, killing both young men and young women, the old and the infirm. God handed all of them over to Nebuchadnezzar.",
