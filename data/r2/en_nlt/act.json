      "In my first book I told you, Theophilus, about everything Jesus began to do and teach",
      "until the day he was taken up to heaven after giving his chosen apostles further instructions through the Holy Spirit.",
      "During the forty days after he suffered and died, he appeared to the apostles from time to time, and he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive. And he talked to them about the Kingdom of God.",
      "Once when he was eating with them, he commanded them, “Do not leave Jerusalem until the Father sends you the gift he promised, as I told you before.",
      "John baptized with water, but in just a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”",
      "So when the apostles were with Jesus, they kept asking him, “Lord, has the time come for you to free Israel and restore our kingdom?”",
      "He replied, “The Father alone has the authority to set those dates and times, and they are not for you to know.",
      "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere—in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”",
      "After saying this, he was taken up into a cloud while they were watching, and they could no longer see him.",
      "As they strained to see him rising into heaven, two white-robed men suddenly stood among them.",
      "“Men of Galilee,” they said, “why are you standing here staring into heaven? Jesus has been taken from you into heaven, but someday he will return from heaven in the same way you saw him go!”",
      "Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, a distance of half a mile.",
      "When they arrived, they went to the upstairs room of the house where they were staying.\nHere are the names of those who were present: Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James (son of Alphaeus), Simon (the zealot), and Judas (son of James).",
      "They all met together and were constantly united in prayer, along with Mary the mother of Jesus, several other women, and the brothers of Jesus.",
      "During this time, when about 120 believers were together in one place, Peter stood up and addressed them.",
      "“Brothers,” he said, “the Scriptures had to be fulfilled concerning Judas, who guided those who arrested Jesus. This was predicted long ago by the Holy Spirit, speaking through King David.",
      "Judas was one of us and shared in the ministry with us.”",
      "(Judas had bought a field with the money he received for his treachery. Falling headfirst there, his body split open, spilling out all his intestines.",
      "The news of his death spread to all the people of Jerusalem, and they gave the place the Aramaic name Akeldama, which means “Field of Blood.”)",
      "Peter continued, “This was written in the book of Psalms, where it says, ‘Let his home become desolate, with no one living in it.’ It also says, ‘Let someone else take his position.’",
      "“So now we must choose a replacement for Judas from among the men who were with us the entire time we were traveling with the Lord Jesus—",
      "from the time he was baptized by John until the day he was taken from us. Whoever is chosen will join us as a witness of Jesus’ resurrection.”",
      "So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.",
      "Then they all prayed, “O Lord, you know every heart. Show us which of these men you have chosen",
      "as an apostle to replace Judas in this ministry, for he has deserted us and gone where he belongs.”",
      "Then they cast lots, and Matthias was selected to become an apostle with the other eleven."

      "On the day of Pentecost all the believers were meeting together in one place.",
      "Suddenly, there was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty windstorm, and it filled the house where they were sitting.",
      "Then, what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them.",
      "And everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other languages, as the Holy Spirit gave them this ability.",
      "At that time there were devout Jews from every nation living in Jerusalem.",
      "When they heard the loud noise, everyone came running, and they were bewildered to hear their own languages being spoken by the believers.",
      "They were completely amazed. “How can this be?” they exclaimed. “These people are all from Galilee,",
      "and yet we hear them speaking in our own native languages!",
      "Here we are—Parthians, Medes, Elamites, people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, the province of Asia,",
      "Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the areas of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome",
      "(both Jews and converts to Judaism), Cretans, and Arabs. And we all hear these people speaking in our own languages about the wonderful things God has done!”",
      "They stood there amazed and perplexed. “What can this mean?” they asked each other.",
      "But others in the crowd ridiculed them, saying, “They’re just drunk, that’s all!”",
      "Then Peter stepped forward with the eleven other apostles and shouted to the crowd, “Listen carefully, all of you, fellow Jews and residents of Jerusalem! Make no mistake about this.",
      "These people are not drunk, as some of you are assuming. Nine o’clock in the morning is much too early for that.",
      "No, what you see was predicted long ago by the prophet Joel:",
      "‘In the last days,’ God says,\n    ‘I will pour out my Spirit upon all people.\nYour sons and daughters will prophesy.\n    Your young men will see visions,\n    and your old men will dream dreams.",
      "In those days I will pour out my Spirit\n    even on my servants—men and women alike—\n    and they will prophesy.",
      "And I will cause wonders in the heavens above\n    and signs on the earth below—\n    blood and fire and clouds of smoke.",
      "The sun will become dark,\n    and the moon will turn blood red\n    before that great and glorious day of the Lord arrives.",
      "But everyone who calls on the name of the Lord\n    will be saved.’",
      "“People of Israel, listen! God publicly endorsed Jesus the Nazarene by doing powerful miracles, wonders, and signs through him, as you well know.",
      "But God knew what would happen, and his prearranged plan was carried out when Jesus was betrayed. With the help of lawless Gentiles, you nailed him to a cross and killed him.",
      "But God released him from the horrors of death and raised him back to life, for death could not keep him in its grip.",
      "King David said this about him:\n‘I see that the Lord is always with me.\n    I will not be shaken, for he is right beside me.",
      "No wonder my heart is glad,\n    and my tongue shouts his praises!\n    My body rests in hope.",
      "For you will not leave my soul among the dead\n    or allow your Holy One to rot in the grave.",
      "You have shown me the way of life,\n    and you will fill me with the joy of your presence.’",
      "“Dear brothers, think about this! You can be sure that the patriarch David wasn’t referring to himself, for he died and was buried, and his tomb is still here among us.",
      "But he was a prophet, and he knew God had promised with an oath that one of David’s own descendants would sit on his throne.",
      "David was looking into the future and speaking of the Messiah’s resurrection. He was saying that God would not leave him among the dead or allow his body to rot in the grave.",
      "“God raised Jesus from the dead, and we are all witnesses of this.",
      "Now he is exalted to the place of highest honor in heaven, at God’s right hand. And the Father, as he had promised, gave him the Holy Spirit to pour out upon us, just as you see and hear today.",
      "For David himself never ascended into heaven, yet he said,\n‘The Lord said to my Lord,\n    “Sit in the place of honor at my right hand",
      "until I humble your enemies,\n    making them a footstool under your feet.”’",
      "“So let everyone in Israel know for certain that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, to be both Lord and Messiah!”",
      "Peter’s words pierced their hearts, and they said to him and to the other apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?”",
      "Peter replied, “Each of you must repent of your sins and turn to God, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.",
      "This promise is to you, to your children, and to those far away—all who have been called by the Lord our God.”",
      "Then Peter continued preaching for a long time, strongly urging all his listeners, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation!”",
      "Those who believed what Peter said were baptized and added to the church that day—about 3,000 in all.",
      "All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching, and to fellowship, and to sharing in meals (including the Lord’s Supper), and to prayer.",
      "A deep sense of awe came over them all, and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders.",
      "And all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had.",
      "They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need.",
      "They worshiped together at the Temple each day, met in homes for the Lord’s Supper, and shared their meals with great joy and generosity—",
      "all the while praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And each day the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved."

      "Peter and John went to the Temple one afternoon to take part in the three o’clock prayer service.",
      "As they approached the Temple, a man lame from birth was being carried in. Each day he was put beside the Temple gate, the one called the Beautiful Gate, so he could beg from the people going into the Temple.",
      "When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for some money.",
      "Peter and John looked at him intently, and Peter said, “Look at us!”",
      "The lame man looked at them eagerly, expecting some money.",
      "But Peter said, “I don’t have any silver or gold for you. But I’ll give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, get up and walk!”",
      "Then Peter took the lame man by the right hand and helped him up. And as he did, the man’s feet and ankles were instantly healed and strengthened.",
      "He jumped up, stood on his feet, and began to walk! Then, walking, leaping, and praising God, he went into the Temple with them.",
      "All the people saw him walking and heard him praising God.",
      "When they realized he was the lame beggar they had seen so often at the Beautiful Gate, they were absolutely astounded!",
      "They all rushed out in amazement to Solomon’s Colonnade, where the man was holding tightly to Peter and John.",
      "Peter saw his opportunity and addressed the crowd. “People of Israel,” he said, “what is so surprising about this? And why stare at us as though we had made this man walk by our own power or godliness?",
      "For it is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the God of all our ancestors—who has brought glory to his servant Jesus by doing this. This is the same Jesus whom you handed over and rejected before Pilate, despite Pilate’s decision to release him.",
      "You rejected this holy, righteous one and instead demanded the release of a murderer.",
      "You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. And we are witnesses of this fact!",
      "“Through faith in the name of Jesus, this man was healed—and you know how crippled he was before. Faith in Jesus’ name has healed him before your very eyes.",
      "“Friends, I realize that what you and your leaders did to Jesus was done in ignorance.",
      "But God was fulfilling what all the prophets had foretold about the Messiah—that he must suffer these things.",
      "Now repent of your sins and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped away.",
      "Then times of refreshment will come from the presence of the Lord, and he will again send you Jesus, your appointed Messiah.",
      "For he must remain in heaven until the time for the final restoration of all things, as God promised long ago through his holy prophets.",
      "Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from among your own people. Listen carefully to everything he tells you.’",
      "Then Moses said, ‘Anyone who will not listen to that Prophet will be completely cut off from God’s people.’",
      "“Starting with Samuel, every prophet spoke about what is happening today.",
      "You are the children of those prophets, and you are included in the covenant God promised to your ancestors. For God said to Abraham, ‘Through your descendants all the families on earth will be blessed.’",
      "When God raised up his servant, Jesus, he sent him first to you people of Israel, to bless you by turning each of you back from your sinful ways.”"

      "While Peter and John were speaking to the people, they were confronted by the priests, the captain of the Temple guard, and some of the Sadducees.",
      "These leaders were very disturbed that Peter and John were teaching the people that through Jesus there is a resurrection of the dead.",
      "They arrested them and, since it was already evening, put them in jail until morning.",
      "But many of the people who heard their message believed it, so the number of men who believed now totaled about 5,000.",
      "The next day the council of all the rulers and elders and teachers of religious law met in Jerusalem.",
      "Annas the high priest was there, along with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and other relatives of the high priest.",
      "They brought in the two disciples and demanded, “By what power, or in whose name, have you done this?”",
      "Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers and elders of our people,",
      "are we being questioned today because we’ve done a good deed for a crippled man? Do you want to know how he was healed?",
      "Let me clearly state to all of you and to all the people of Israel that he was healed by the powerful name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, the man you crucified but whom God raised from the dead.",
      "For Jesus is the one referred to in the Scriptures, where it says,\n‘The stone that you builders rejected\n    has now become the cornerstone.’",
      "There is salvation in no one else! God has given no other name under heaven by which we must be saved.”",
      "The members of the council were amazed when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, for they could see that they were ordinary men with no special training in the Scriptures. They also recognized them as men who had been with Jesus.",
      "But since they could see the man who had been healed standing right there among them, there was nothing the council could say.",
      "So they ordered Peter and John out of the council chamber and conferred among themselves.",
      "“What should we do with these men?” they asked each other. “We can’t deny that they have performed a miraculous sign, and everybody in Jerusalem knows about it.",
      "But to keep them from spreading their propaganda any further, we must warn them not to speak to anyone in Jesus’ name again.”",
      "So they called the apostles back in and commanded them never again to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.",
      "But Peter and John replied, “Do you think God wants us to obey you rather than him?",
      "We cannot stop telling about everything we have seen and heard.”",
      "The council then threatened them further, but they finally let them go because they didn’t know how to punish them without starting a riot. For everyone was praising God",
      "for this miraculous sign—the healing of a man who had been lame for more than forty years.",
      "As soon as they were freed, Peter and John returned to the other believers and told them what the leading priests and elders had said.",
      "When they heard the report, all the believers lifted their voices together in prayer to God: “O Sovereign Lord, Creator of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them—",
      "you spoke long ago by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David, your servant, saying,\n‘Why were the nations so angry?\n    Why did they waste their time with futile plans?",
      "The kings of the earth prepared for battle;\n    the rulers gathered together\nagainst the Lord\n    and against his Messiah.’",
      "“In fact, this has happened here in this very city! For Herod Antipas, Pontius Pilate the governor, the Gentiles, and the people of Israel were all united against Jesus, your holy servant, whom you anointed.",
      "But everything they did was determined beforehand according to your will.",
      "And now, O Lord, hear their threats, and give us, your servants, great boldness in preaching your word.",
      "Stretch out your hand with healing power; may miraculous signs and wonders be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”",
      "After this prayer, the meeting place shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit. Then they preached the word of God with boldness.",
      "All the believers were united in heart and mind. And they felt that what they owned was not their own, so they shared everything they had.",
      "The apostles testified powerfully to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and God’s great blessing was upon them all.",
      "There were no needy people among them, because those who owned land or houses would sell them",
      "and bring the money to the apostles to give to those in need.",
      "For instance, there was Joseph, the one the apostles nicknamed Barnabas (which means “Son of Encouragement”). He was from the tribe of Levi and came from the island of Cyprus.",
      "He sold a field he owned and brought the money to the apostles."

    [
      "But there was a certain man named Ananias who, with his wife, Sapphira, sold some property.",
      "He brought part of the money to the apostles, claiming it was the full amount. With his wife’s consent, he kept the rest.",
      "Then Peter said, “Ananias, why have you let Satan fill your heart? You lied to the Holy Spirit, and you kept some of the money for yourself.",
      "The property was yours to sell or not sell, as you wished. And after selling it, the money was also yours to give away. How could you do a thing like this? You weren’t lying to us but to God!”",
      "As soon as Ananias heard these words, he fell to the floor and died. Everyone who heard about it was terrified.",
      "Then some young men got up, wrapped him in a sheet, and took him out and buried him.",
      "About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.",
      "Peter asked her, “Was this the price you and your husband received for your land?”\n“Yes,” she replied, “that was the price.”",
      "And Peter said, “How could the two of you even think of conspiring to test the Spirit of the Lord like this? The young men who buried your husband are just outside the door, and they will carry you out, too.”",
      "Instantly, she fell to the floor and died. When the young men came in and saw that she was dead, they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.",
      "Great fear gripped the entire church and everyone else who heard what had happened.",
      "The apostles were performing many miraculous signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers were meeting regularly at the Temple in the area known as Solomon’s Colonnade.",
      "But no one else dared to join them, even though all the people had high regard for them.",
      "Yet more and more people believed and were brought to the Lord—crowds of both men and women.",
      "As a result of the apostles’ work, sick people were brought out into the streets on beds and mats so that Peter’s shadow might fall across some of them as he went by.",
      "Crowds came from the villages around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those possessed by evil spirits, and they were all healed.",
      "The high priest and his officials, who were Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.",
      "They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.",
      "But an angel of the Lord came at night, opened the gates of the jail, and brought them out. Then he told them,",
      "“Go to the Temple and give the people this message of life!”",
      "So at daybreak the apostles entered the Temple, as they were told, and immediately began teaching.\nWhen the high priest and his officials arrived, they convened the high council—the full assembly of the elders of Israel. Then they sent for the apostles to be brought from the jail for trial.",
      "But when the Temple guards went to the jail, the men were gone. So they returned to the council and reported,",
      "“The jail was securely locked, with the guards standing outside, but when we opened the gates, no one was there!”",
      "When the captain of the Temple guard and the leading priests heard this, they were perplexed, wondering where it would all end.",
      "Then someone arrived with startling news: “The men you put in jail are standing in the Temple, teaching the people!”",
      "The captain went with his Temple guards and arrested the apostles, but without violence, for they were afraid the people would stone them.",
      "Then they brought the apostles before the high council, where the high priest confronted them.",
      "“We gave you strict orders never again to teach in this man’s name!” he said. “Instead, you have filled all Jerusalem with your teaching about him, and you want to make us responsible for his death!”",
      "But Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than any human authority.",
      "The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead after you killed him by hanging him on a cross.",
      "Then God put him in the place of honor at his right hand as Prince and Savior. He did this so the people of Israel would repent of their sins and be forgiven.",
      "We are witnesses of these things and so is the Holy Spirit, who is given by God to those who obey him.”",
      "When they heard this, the high council was furious and decided to kill them.",
      "But one member, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, who was an expert in religious law and respected by all the people, stood up and ordered that the men be sent outside the council chamber for a while.",
      "Then he said to his colleagues, “Men of Israel, take care what you are planning to do to these men!",
      "Some time ago there was that fellow Theudas, who pretended to be someone great. About 400 others joined him, but he was killed, and all his followers went their various ways. The whole movement came to nothing.",
      "After him, at the time of the census, there was Judas of Galilee. He got people to follow him, but he was killed, too, and all his followers were scattered.",
      "“So my advice is, leave these men alone. Let them go. If they are planning and doing these things merely on their own, it will soon be overthrown.",
      "But if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You may even find yourselves fighting against God!”",
      "The others accepted his advice. They called in the apostles and had them flogged. Then they ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus, and they let them go.",
      "The apostles left the high council rejoicing that God had counted them worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus.",
      "And every day, in the Temple and from house to house, they continued to teach and preach this message: “Jesus is the Messiah.”"

    [
      "But as the believers rapidly multiplied, there were rumblings of discontent. The Greek-speaking believers complained about the Hebrew-speaking believers, saying that their widows were being discriminated against in the daily distribution of food.",
      "So the Twelve called a meeting of all the believers. They said, “We apostles should spend our time teaching the word of God, not running a food program.",
      "And so, brothers, select seven men who are well respected and are full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will give them this responsibility.",
      "Then we apostles can spend our time in prayer and teaching the word.”",
      "Everyone liked this idea, and they chose the following: Stephen (a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit), Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas of Antioch (an earlier convert to the Jewish faith).",
      "These seven were presented to the apostles, who prayed for them as they laid their hands on them.",
      "So God’s message continued to spread. The number of believers greatly increased in Jerusalem, and many of the Jewish priests were converted, too.",
      "Stephen, a man full of God’s grace and power, performed amazing miracles and signs among the people.",
      "But one day some men from the Synagogue of Freed Slaves, as it was called, started to debate with him. They were Jews from Cyrene, Alexandria, Cilicia, and the province of Asia.",
      "None of them could stand against the wisdom and the Spirit with which Stephen spoke.",
      "So they persuaded some men to lie about Stephen, saying, “We heard him blaspheme Moses, and even God.”",
      "This roused the people, the elders, and the teachers of religious law. So they arrested Stephen and brought him before the high council.",
      "The lying witnesses said, “This man is always speaking against the holy Temple and against the law of Moses.",
      "We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy the Temple and change the customs Moses handed down to us.”",
      "At this point everyone in the high council stared at Stephen, because his face became as bright as an angel’s."

    [
      "Then the high priest asked Stephen, “Are these accusations true?”",
      "This was Stephen’s reply: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me. Our glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham in Mesopotamia before he settled in Haran.",
      "God told him, ‘Leave your native land and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.’",
      "So Abraham left the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran until his father died. Then God brought him here to the land where you now live.",
      "“But God gave him no inheritance here, not even one square foot of land. God did promise, however, that eventually the whole land would belong to Abraham and his descendants—even though he had no children yet.",
      "God also told him that his descendants would live in a foreign land, where they would be oppressed as slaves for 400 years.",
      "‘But I will punish the nation that enslaves them,’ God said, ‘and in the end they will come out and worship me here in this place.’",
      "“God also gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision at that time. So when Abraham became the father of Isaac, he circumcised him on the eighth day. And the practice was continued when Isaac became the father of Jacob, and when Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs of the Israelite nation.",
      "“These patriarchs were jealous of their brother Joseph, and they sold him to be a slave in Egypt. But God was with him",
      "and rescued him from all his troubles. And God gave him favor before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. God also gave Joseph unusual wisdom, so that Pharaoh appointed him governor over all of Egypt and put him in charge of the palace.",
      "“But a famine came upon Egypt and Canaan. There was great misery, and our ancestors ran out of food.",
      "Jacob heard that there was still grain in Egypt, so he sent his sons—our ancestors—to buy some.",
      "The second time they went, Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers, and they were introduced to Pharaoh.",
      "Then Joseph sent for his father, Jacob, and all his relatives to come to Egypt, seventy-five persons in all.",
      "So Jacob went to Egypt. He died there, as did our ancestors.",
      "Their bodies were taken to Shechem and buried in the tomb Abraham had bought for a certain price from Hamor’s sons in Shechem.",
      "“As the time drew near when God would fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt greatly increased.",
      "But then a new king came to the throne of Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph.",
      "This king exploited our people and oppressed them, forcing parents to abandon their newborn babies so they would die.",
      "“At that time Moses was born—a beautiful child in God’s eyes. His parents cared for him at home for three months.",
      "When they had to abandon him, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him and raised him as her own son.",
      "Moses was taught all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in both speech and action.",
      "“One day when Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his relatives, the people of Israel.",
      "He saw an Egyptian mistreating an Israelite. So Moses came to the man’s defense and avenged him, killing the Egyptian.",
      "Moses assumed his fellow Israelites would realize that God had sent him to rescue them, but they didn’t.",
      "“The next day he visited them again and saw two men of Israel fighting. He tried to be a peacemaker. ‘Men,’ he said, ‘you are brothers. Why are you fighting each other?’",
      "“But the man in the wrong pushed Moses aside. ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us?’ he asked.",
      "‘Are you going to kill me as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?’",
      "When Moses heard that, he fled the country and lived as a foreigner in the land of Midian. There his two sons were born.",

      "Many who became believers confessed their sinful practices.",

      "Of course, I’m not just talking about the loss of public respect for our business. I’m also concerned that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will lose its influence and that Artemis—this magnificent goddess worshiped throughout the province of Asia and all around the world—will be robbed of her great prestige!”",
      "At this their anger boiled, and they began shouting, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”",

      "At last the mayor was able to quiet them down enough to speak. “Citizens of Ephesus,” he said. “Everyone knows that Ephesus is the official guardian of the temple of the great Artemis, whose image fell down to us from heaven.",
      "Since this is an undeniable fact, you should stay calm and not do anything rash.",
      "You have brought these men here, but they have stolen nothing from the temple and have not spoken against our goddess.",
      "“If Demetrius and the craftsmen have a case against them, the courts are in session and the officials can hear the case at once. Let them make formal charges.",
      "And if there are complaints about other matters, they can be settled in a legal assembly.",
      "I am afraid we are in danger of being charged with rioting by the Roman government, since there is no cause for all this commotion. And if Rome demands an explanation, we won’t know what to say.”",

      "Instead, it was something about their religion and a dead man named Jesus, who Paul insists is alive.",
      "I was at a loss to know how to investigate these things, so I asked him whether he would be willing to stand trial on these charges in Jerusalem.",
      "But Paul appealed to have his case decided by the emperor. So I ordered that he be held in custody until I could arrange to send him to Caesar.”",
      "“I’d like to hear the man myself,” Agrippa said.\nAnd Festus replied, “You will—tomorrow!”",
      "So the next day Agrippa and Bernice arrived at the auditorium with great pomp, accompanied by military officers and prominent men of the city. Festus ordered that Paul be brought in.",
      "Then Festus said, “King Agrippa and all who are here, this is the man whose death is demanded by all the Jews, both here and in Jerusalem.",
      "But in my opinion he has done nothing deserving death. However, since he appealed his case to the emperor, I have decided to send him to Rome.",
      "“But what shall I write the emperor? For there is no clear charge against him. So I have brought him before all of you, and especially you, King Agrippa, so that after we examine him, I might have something to write.",
      "For it makes no sense to send a prisoner to the emperor without specifying the charges against him!”"

      "Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You may speak in your defense.”\nSo Paul, gesturing with his hand, started his defense:",
      "“I am fortunate, King Agrippa, that you are the one hearing my defense today against all these accusations made by the Jewish leaders,",
      "for I know you are an expert on all Jewish customs and controversies. Now please listen to me patiently!",
      "“As the Jewish leaders are well aware, I was given a thorough Jewish training from my earliest childhood among my own people and in Jerusalem.",
      "If they would admit it, they know that I have been a member of the Pharisees, the strictest sect of our religion.",
      "Now I am on trial because of my hope in the fulfillment of God’s promise made to our ancestors.",
      "In fact, that is why the twelve tribes of Israel zealously worship God night and day, and they share the same hope I have. Yet, Your Majesty, they accuse me for having this hope!",
      "Why does it seem incredible to any of you that God can raise the dead?",
      "“I used to believe that I ought to do everything I could to oppose the very name of Jesus the Nazarene.",
      "Indeed, I did just that in Jerusalem. Authorized by the leading priests, I caused many believers there to be sent to prison. And I cast my vote against them when they were condemned to death.",
      "Many times I had them punished in the synagogues to get them to curse Jesus. I was so violently opposed to them that I even chased them down in foreign cities.",
      "“One day I was on such a mission to Damascus, armed with the authority and commission of the leading priests.",
      "About noon, Your Majesty, as I was on the road, a light from heaven brighter than the sun shone down on me and my companions.",
      "We all fell down, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is useless for you to fight against my will.’",
      "“‘Who are you, lord?’ I asked.\n“And the Lord replied, ‘I am Jesus, the one you are persecuting.",
      "Now get to your feet! For I have appeared to you to appoint you as my servant and witness. Tell people that you have seen me, and tell them what I will show you in the future.",
      "And I will rescue you from both your own people and the Gentiles. Yes, I am sending you to the Gentiles",
      "to open their eyes, so they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God. Then they will receive forgiveness for their sins and be given a place among God’s people, who are set apart by faith in me.’",
      "“And so, King Agrippa, I obeyed that vision from heaven.",
      "I preached first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that all must repent of their sins and turn to God—and prove they have changed by the good things they do.",
      "Some Jews arrested me in the Temple for preaching this, and they tried to kill me.",
      "But God has protected me right up to this present time so I can testify to everyone, from the least to the greatest. I teach nothing except what the prophets and Moses said would happen—",
      "that the Messiah would suffer and be the first to rise from the dead, and in this way announce God’s light to Jews and Gentiles alike.”",
      "Suddenly, Festus shouted, “Paul, you are insane. Too much study has made you crazy!”",
      "But Paul replied, “I am not insane, Most Excellent Festus. What I am saying is the sober truth.",
      "And King Agrippa knows about these things. I speak boldly, for I am sure these events are all familiar to him, for they were not done in a corner!",
      "King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do—”",
      "Agrippa interrupted him. “Do you think you can persuade me to become a Christian so quickly?”",
      "Paul replied, “Whether quickly or not, I pray to God that both you and everyone here in this audience might become the same as I am, except for these chains.”",
      "Then the king, the governor, Bernice, and all the others stood and left.",
      "As they went out, they talked it over and agreed, “This man hasn’t done anything to deserve death or imprisonment.”",
      "And Agrippa said to Festus, “He could have been set free if he hadn’t appealed to Caesar.”"

      "When the time came, we set sail for Italy. Paul and several other prisoners were placed in the custody of a Roman officer named Julius, a captain of the Imperial Regiment.",
      "Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was also with us. We left on a ship whose home port was Adramyttium on the northwest coast of the province of Asia; it was scheduled to make several stops at ports along the coast of the province.",
      "The next day when we docked at Sidon, Julius was very kind to Paul and let him go ashore to visit with friends so they could provide for his needs.",
      "Putting out to sea from there, we encountered strong headwinds that made it difficult to keep the ship on course, so we sailed north of Cyprus between the island and the mainland.",
      "Keeping to the open sea, we passed along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, landing at Myra, in the province of Lycia.",
      "There the commanding officer found an Egyptian ship from Alexandria that was bound for Italy, and he put us on board.",
      "We had several days of slow sailing, and after great difficulty we finally neared Cnidus. But the wind was against us, so we sailed across to Crete and along the sheltered coast of the island, past the cape of Salmone.",
      "We struggled along the coast with great difficulty and finally arrived at Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.",
      "We had lost a lot of time. The weather was becoming dangerous for sea travel because it was so late in the fall, and Paul spoke to the ship’s officers about it.",
      "“Men,” he said, “I believe there is trouble ahead if we go on—shipwreck, loss of cargo, and danger to our lives as well.”",
      "But the officer in charge of the prisoners listened more to the ship’s captain and the owner than to Paul.",
      "And since Fair Havens was an exposed harbor—a poor place to spend the winter—most of the crew wanted to go on to Phoenix, farther up the coast of Crete, and spend the winter there. Phoenix was a good harbor with only a southwest and northwest exposure.",
      "When a light wind began blowing from the south, the sailors thought they could make it. So they pulled up anchor and sailed close to the shore of Crete.",
      "But the weather changed abruptly, and a wind of typhoon strength (called a “northeaster”) burst across the island and blew us out to sea.",
      "The sailors couldn’t turn the ship into the wind, so they gave up and let it run before the gale.",
      "We sailed along the sheltered side of a small island named Cauda, where with great difficulty we hoisted aboard the lifeboat being towed behind us.",
      "Then the sailors bound ropes around the hull of the ship to strengthen it. They were afraid of being driven across to the sandbars of Syrtis off the African coast, so they lowered the sea anchor to slow the ship and were driven before the wind.",
      "The next day, as gale-force winds continued to batter the ship, the crew began throwing the cargo overboard.",
      "The following day they even took some of the ship’s gear and threw it overboard.",
      "The terrible storm raged for many days, blotting out the sun and the stars, until at last all hope was gone.",
      "No one had eaten for a long time. Finally, Paul called the crew together and said, “Men, you should have listened to me in the first place and not left Crete. You would have avoided all this damage and loss.",
      "But take courage! None of you will lose your lives, even though the ship will go down.",
      "For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me,",
      "and he said, ‘Don’t be afraid, Paul, for you will surely stand trial before Caesar! What’s more, God in his goodness has granted safety to everyone sailing with you.’",
      "So take courage! For I believe God. It will be just as he said.",
      "But we will be shipwrecked on an island.”",
      "About midnight on the fourteenth night of the storm, as we were being driven across the Sea of Adria, the sailors sensed land was near.",
      "They dropped a weighted line and found that the water was 120 feet deep. But a little later they measured again and found it was only 90 feet deep.",
      "At this rate they were afraid we would soon be driven against the rocks along the shore, so they threw out four anchors from the back of the ship and prayed for daylight.",
      "Then the sailors tried to abandon the ship; they lowered the lifeboat as though they were going to put out anchors from the front of the ship.",
      "But Paul said to the commanding officer and the soldiers, “You will all die unless the sailors stay aboard.”",
      "So the soldiers cut the ropes to the lifeboat and let it drift away.",
      "Just as day was dawning, Paul urged everyone to eat. “You have been so worried that you haven’t touched food for two weeks,” he said.",
      "“Please eat something now for your own good. For not a hair of your heads will perish.”",
      "Then he took some bread, gave thanks to God before them all, and broke off a piece and ate it.",
      "Then everyone was encouraged and began to eat—",
      "all 276 of us who were on board.",
      "After eating, the crew lightened the ship further by throwing the cargo of wheat overboard.",
      "When morning dawned, they didn’t recognize the coastline, but they saw a bay with a beach and wondered if they could get to shore by running the ship aground.",
      "So they cut off the anchors and left them in the sea. Then they lowered the rudders, raised the foresail, and headed toward shore.",
      "But they hit a shoal and ran the ship aground too soon. The bow of the ship stuck fast, while the stern was repeatedly smashed by the force of the waves and began to break apart.",
      "The soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners to make sure they didn’t swim ashore and escape.",
      "But the commanding officer wanted to spare Paul, so he didn’t let them carry out their plan. Then he ordered all who could swim to jump overboard first and make for land.",
      "The others held on to planks or debris from the broken ship. So everyone escaped safely to shore."
    ],
    [
      "Once we were safe on shore, we learned that we were on the island of Malta.",
      "The people of the island were very kind to us. It was cold and rainy, so they built a fire on the shore to welcome us.",
      "As Paul gathered an armful of sticks and was laying them on the fire, a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, bit him on the hand.",
      "The people of the island saw it hanging from his hand and said to each other, “A murderer, no doubt! Though he escaped the sea, justice will not permit him to live.”",
      "But Paul shook off the snake into the fire and was unharmed.",
      "The people waited for him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. But when they had waited a long time and saw that he wasn’t harmed, they changed their minds and decided he was a god.",
      "Near the shore where we landed was an estate belonging to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us and treated us kindly for three days.",
      "As it happened, Publius’s father was ill with fever and dysentery. Paul went in and prayed for him, and laying his hands on him, he healed him.",
      "Then all the other sick people on the island came and were healed.",
      "As a result we were showered with honors, and when the time came to sail, people supplied us with everything we would need for the trip.",
      "It was three months after the shipwreck that we set sail on another ship that had wintered at the island—an Alexandrian ship with the twin gods as its figurehead.",
      "Our first stop was Syracuse, where we stayed three days.",
      "From there we sailed across to Rhegium. A day later a south wind began blowing, so the following day we sailed up the coast to Puteoli.",
      "There we found some believers, who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome.",
      "The brothers and sisters in Rome had heard we were coming, and they came to meet us at the Forum on the Appian Way. Others joined us at The Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he was encouraged and thanked God.",
      "When we arrived in Rome, Paul was permitted to have his own private lodging, though he was guarded by a soldier.",
      "Three days after Paul’s arrival, he called together the local Jewish leaders. He said to them, “Brothers, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Roman government, even though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors.",
      "The Romans tried me and wanted to release me, because they found no cause for the death sentence.",
      "But when the Jewish leaders protested the decision, I felt it necessary to appeal to Caesar, even though I had no desire to press charges against my own people.",
      "I asked you to come here today so we could get acquainted and so I could explain to you that I am bound with this chain because I believe that the hope of Israel—the Messiah—has already come.”",
      "They replied, “We have had no letters from Judea or reports against you from anyone who has come here.",
      "But we want to hear what you believe, for the only thing we know about this movement is that it is denounced everywhere.”",
      "So a time was set, and on that day a large number of people came to Paul’s lodging. He explained and testified about the Kingdom of God and tried to persuade them about Jesus from the Scriptures. Using the law of Moses and the books of the prophets, he spoke to them from morning until evening.",
      "Some were persuaded by the things he said, but others did not believe.",
      "And after they had argued back and forth among themselves, they left with this final word from Paul: “The Holy Spirit was right when he said to your ancestors through Isaiah the prophet,",
      "‘Go and say to this people:\nWhen you hear what I say,\n    you will not understand.\nWhen you see what I do,\n    you will not comprehend.",
      "For the hearts of these people are hardened,\n    and their ears cannot hear,\n    and they have closed their eyes—\nso their eyes cannot see,\n    and their ears cannot hear,\n    and their hearts cannot understand,\nand they cannot turn to me\n    and let me heal them.’",
      "So I want you to know that this salvation from God has also been offered to the Gentiles, and they will accept it.”",
      "",
      "For the next two years, Paul lived in Rome at his own expense. He welcomed all who visited him,",
      "boldly proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ. And no one tried to stop him."
