      "King David was now very old, and no matter how many blankets covered him, he could not keep warm.",
      "So his advisers told him, “Let us find a young virgin to wait on you and look after you, my lord. She will lie in your arms and keep you warm.”",
      "So they searched throughout the land of Israel for a beautiful girl, and they found Abishag from Shunem and brought her to the king.",
      "The girl was very beautiful, and she looked after the king and took care of him. But the king had no sexual relations with her.",
      "About that time David’s son Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, began boasting, “I will make myself king.” So he provided himself with chariots and charioteers and recruited fifty men to run in front of him.",
      "Now his father, King David, had never disciplined him at any time, even by asking, “Why are you doing that?” Adonijah had been born next after Absalom, and he was very handsome.",
      "Adonijah took Joab son of Zeruiah and Abiathar the priest into his confidence, and they agreed to help him become king.",
      "But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David’s personal bodyguard refused to support Adonijah.",
      "Adonijah went to the Stone of Zoheleth near the spring of En-rogel, where he sacrificed sheep, cattle, and fattened calves. He invited all his brothers—the other sons of King David—and all the royal officials of Judah.",
      "But he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the king’s bodyguard or his brother Solomon.",
      "Then Nathan went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, and asked her, “Haven’t you heard that Haggith’s son, Adonijah, has made himself king, and our lord David doesn’t even know about it?",
      "If you want to save your own life and the life of your son Solomon, follow my advice.",
      "Go at once to King David and say to him, ‘My lord the king, didn’t you make a vow and say to me, “Your son Solomon will surely be the next king and will sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’",
      "And while you are still talking with him, I will come and confirm everything you have said.”",
      "So Bathsheba went into the king’s bedroom. (He was very old now, and Abishag was taking care of him.)",
      "Bathsheba bowed down before the king.\n“What can I do for you?” he asked her.",
      "She replied, “My lord, you made a vow before the Lord your God when you said to me, ‘Your son Solomon will surely be the next king and will sit on my throne.’",
      "But instead, Adonijah has made himself king, and my lord the king does not even know about it.",
      "He has sacrificed many cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and he has invited all the king’s sons to attend the celebration. He also invited Abiathar the priest and Joab, the commander of the army. But he did not invite your servant Solomon.",
      "And now, my lord the king, all Israel is waiting for you to announce who will become king after you.",
      "If you do not act, my son Solomon and I will be treated as criminals as soon as my lord the king has died.”",
      "While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.",
      "The king’s officials told him, “Nathan the prophet is here to see you.”\nNathan went in and bowed before the king with his face to the ground.",
      "Nathan asked, “My lord the king, have you decided that Adonijah will be the next king and that he will sit on your throne?",
      "Today he has sacrificed many cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and he has invited all the king’s sons to attend the celebration. He also invited the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. They are feasting and drinking with him and shouting, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’",
      "But he did not invite me or Zadok the priest or Benaiah or your servant Solomon.",
      "Has my lord the king really done this without letting any of his officials know who should be the next king?”",
      "King David responded, “Call Bathsheba!” So she came back in and stood before the king.",
      "And the king repeated his vow: “As surely as the Lord lives, who has rescued me from every danger,",
      "your son Solomon will be the next king and will sit on my throne this very day, just as I vowed to you before the Lord, the God of Israel.”",
      "Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground before the king and exclaimed, “May my lord King David live forever!”",
      "Then King David ordered, “Call Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” When they came into the king’s presence,",
      "the king said to them, “Take Solomon and my officials down to Gihon Spring. Solomon is to ride on my own mule.",
      "There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint him king over Israel. Blow the ram’s horn and shout, ‘Long live King Solomon!’",
      "Then escort him back here, and he will sit on my throne. He will succeed me as king, for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.”",
      "“Amen!” Benaiah son of Jehoiada replied. “May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, decree that it happen.",
      "And may the Lord be with Solomon as he has been with you, my lord the king, and may he make Solomon’s reign even greater than yours!”",
      "So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the king’s bodyguard took Solomon down to Gihon Spring, with Solomon riding on King David’s own mule.",
      "There Zadok the priest took the flask of olive oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon with the oil. Then they sounded the ram’s horn and all the people shouted, “Long live King Solomon!”",
      "And all the people followed Solomon into Jerusalem, playing flutes and shouting for joy. The celebration was so joyous and noisy that the earth shook with the sound.",
      "Adonijah and his guests heard the celebrating and shouting just as they were finishing their banquet. When Joab heard the sound of the ram’s horn, he asked, “What’s going on? Why is the city in such an uproar?”",
      "And while he was still speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. “Come in,” Adonijah said to him, “for you are a good man. You must have good news.”",
      "“Not at all!” Jonathan replied. “Our lord King David has just declared Solomon king!",
      "The king sent him down to Gihon Spring with Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, protected by the king’s bodyguard. They had him ride on the king’s own mule,",
      "and Zadok and Nathan have anointed him at Gihon Spring as the new king. They have just returned, and the whole city is celebrating and rejoicing. That’s what all the noise is about.",
      "What’s more, Solomon is now sitting on the royal throne as king.",
      "And all the royal officials have gone to King David and congratulated him, saying, ‘May your God make Solomon’s fame even greater than your own, and may Solomon’s reign be even greater than yours!’ Then the king bowed his head in worship as he lay in his bed,",
      "and he said, ‘Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, who today has chosen a successor to sit on my throne while I am still alive to see it.’”",
      "Then all of Adonijah’s guests jumped up in panic from the banquet table and quickly scattered.",
      "Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, so he rushed to the sacred tent and grabbed on to the horns of the altar.",
      "Word soon reached Solomon that Adonijah had seized the horns of the altar in fear, and that he was pleading, “Let King Solomon swear today that he will not kill me!”",
      "Solomon replied, “If he proves himself to be loyal, not a hair on his head will be touched. But if he makes trouble, he will die.”",
      "So King Solomon summoned Adonijah, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed respectfully before King Solomon, who dismissed him, saying, “Go on home.”"

      "As the time of King David’s death approached, he gave this charge to his son Solomon:",
      "“I am going where everyone on earth must someday go. Take courage and be a man.",
      "Observe the requirements of the Lord your God, and follow all his ways. Keep the decrees, commands, regulations, and laws written in the Law of Moses so that you will be successful in all you do and wherever you go.",
      "If you do this, then the Lord will keep the promise he made to me. He told me, ‘If your descendants live as they should and follow me faithfully with all their heart and soul, one of them will always sit on the throne of Israel.’",
      "“And there is something else. You know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me when he murdered my two army commanders, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He pretended that it was an act of war, but it was done in a time of peace, staining his belt and sandals with innocent blood.",
      "Do with him what you think best, but don’t let him grow old and go to his grave in peace.",
      "“Be kind to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead. Make them permanent guests at your table, for they took care of me when I fled from your brother Absalom.",
      "“And remember Shimei son of Gera, the man from Bahurim in Benjamin. He cursed me with a terrible curse as I was fleeing to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan River, I swore by the Lord that I would not kill him.",
      "But that oath does not make him innocent. You are a wise man, and you will know how to arrange a bloody death for him.”",
      "Then David died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David.",
      "David had reigned over Israel for forty years, seven of them in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.",
      "Solomon became king and sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.",
      "One day Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, came to see Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. “Have you come with peaceful intentions?” she asked him.\n“Yes,” he said, “I come in peace.",
      "In fact, I have a favor to ask of you.”\n“What is it?” she asked.",
      "He replied, “As you know, the kingdom was rightfully mine; all Israel wanted me to be the next king. But the tables were turned, and the kingdom went to my brother instead; for that is the way the Lord wanted it.",
      "So now I have just one favor to ask of you. Please don’t turn me down.”\n“What is it?” she asked.",
      "He replied, “Speak to King Solomon on my behalf, for I know he will do anything you request. Ask him to let me marry Abishag, the girl from Shunem.”",
      "“All right,” Bathsheba replied. “I will speak to the king for you.”",
      "So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak on Adonijah’s behalf. The king rose from his throne to meet her, and he bowed down before her. When he sat down on his throne again, the king ordered that a throne be brought for his mother, and she sat at his right hand.",
      "“I have one small request to make of you,” she said. “I hope you won’t turn me down.”\n“What is it, my mother?” he asked. “You know I won’t refuse you.”",
      "“Then let your brother Adonijah marry Abishag, the girl from Shunem,” she replied.",
      "“How can you possibly ask me to give Abishag to Adonijah?” King Solomon demanded. “You might as well ask me to give him the kingdom! You know that he is my older brother, and that he has Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah on his side.”",
      "Then King Solomon made a vow before the Lord: “May God strike me and even kill me if Adonijah has not sealed his fate with this request.",
      "The Lord has confirmed me and placed me on the throne of my father, David; he has established my dynasty as he promised. So as surely as the Lord lives, Adonijah will die this very day!”",
      "So King Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada to execute him, and Adonijah was put to death.",
      "Then the king said to Abiathar the priest, “Go back to your home in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not kill you now, because you carried the Ark of the Sovereign Lord for David my father and you shared all his hardships.”",
      "So Solomon deposed Abiathar from his position as priest of the Lord, thereby fulfilling the prophecy the Lord had given at Shiloh concerning the descendants of Eli.",
      "Joab had not joined Absalom’s earlier rebellion, but he had joined Adonijah’s rebellion. So when Joab heard about Adonijah’s death, he ran to the sacred tent of the Lord and grabbed on to the horns of the altar.",
      "When this was reported to King Solomon, he sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada to execute him.",
      "Benaiah went to the sacred tent of the Lord and said to Joab, “The king orders you to come out!”\nBut Joab answered, “No, I will die here.”\nSo Benaiah returned to the king and told him what Joab had said.",
      "“Do as he said,” the king replied. “Kill him there beside the altar and bury him. This will remove the guilt of Joab’s senseless murders from me and from my father’s family.",
      "The Lord will repay him for the murders of two men who were more righteous and better than he. For my father knew nothing about the deaths of Abner son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and of Amasa son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.",
      "May their blood be on Joab and his descendants forever, and may the Lord grant peace forever to David, his descendants, his dynasty, and his throne.”",
      "So Benaiah son of Jehoiada returned to the sacred tent and killed Joab, and he was buried at his home in the wilderness.",
      "Then the king appointed Benaiah to command the army in place of Joab, and he installed Zadok the priest to take the place of Abiathar.",
      "The king then sent for Shimei and told him, “Build a house here in Jerusalem and live there. But don’t step outside the city to go anywhere else.",
      "On the day you so much as cross the Kidron Valley, you will surely die; and your blood will be on your own head.”",
      "Shimei replied, “Your sentence is fair; I will do whatever my lord the king commands.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.",
      "But three years later two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to King Achish son of Maacah of Gath. When Shimei learned where they were,",
      "he saddled his donkey and went to Gath to search for them. When he found them, he brought them back to Jerusalem.",
      "Solomon heard that Shimei had left Jerusalem and had gone to Gath and returned.",
      "So the king sent for Shimei and demanded, “Didn’t I make you swear by the Lord and warn you not to go anywhere else or you would surely die? And you replied, ‘The sentence is fair; I will do as you say.’",
      "Then why haven’t you kept your oath to the Lord and obeyed my command?”",
      "The king also said to Shimei, “You certainly remember all the wicked things you did to my father, David. May the Lord now bring that evil on your own head.",
      "But may I, King Solomon, receive the Lord’s blessings, and may one of David’s descendants always sit on this throne in the presence of the Lord.”",
      "Then, at the king’s command, Benaiah son of Jehoiada took Shimei outside and killed him.\nSo the kingdom was now firmly in Solomon’s grip."

      "Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and married one of his daughters. He brought her to live in the City of David until he could finish building his palace and the Temple of the Lord and the wall around the city.",
      "At that time the people of Israel sacrificed their offerings at local places of worship, for a temple honoring the name of the Lord had not yet been built.",
      "Solomon loved the Lord and followed all the decrees of his father, David, except that Solomon, too, offered sacrifices and burned incense at the local places of worship.",
      "The most important of these places of worship was at Gibeon, so the king went there and sacrificed 1,000 burnt offerings.",
      "That night the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream, and God said, “What do you want? Ask, and I will give it to you!”",
      "Solomon replied, “You showed great and faithful love to your servant my father, David, because he was honest and true and faithful to you. And you have continued to show this great and faithful love to him today by giving him a son to sit on his throne.",
      "“Now, O Lord my God, you have made me king instead of my father, David, but I am like a little child who doesn’t know his way around.",
      "And here I am in the midst of your own chosen people, a nation so great and numerous they cannot be counted!",
      "Give me an understanding heart so that I can govern your people well and know the difference between right and wrong. For who by himself is able to govern this great people of yours?”",
      "The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for wisdom.",
      "So God replied, “Because you have asked for wisdom in governing my people with justice and have not asked for a long life or wealth or the death of your enemies—",
      "I will give you what you asked for! I will give you a wise and understanding heart such as no one else has had or ever will have!",
      "And I will also give you what you did not ask for—riches and fame! No other king in all the world will be compared to you for the rest of your life!",
      "And if you follow me and obey my decrees and my commands as your father, David, did, I will give you a long life.”",
      "Then Solomon woke up and realized it had been a dream. He returned to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant, where he sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then he invited all his officials to a great banquet.",
      "Some time later two prostitutes came to the king to have an argument settled.",
      "“Please, my lord,” one of them began, “this woman and I live in the same house. I gave birth to a baby while she was with me in the house.",
      "Three days later this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there were only two of us in the house.",
      "“But her baby died during the night when she rolled over on it.",
      "Then she got up in the night and took my son from beside me while I was asleep. She laid her dead child in my arms and took mine to sleep beside her.",
      "And in the morning when I tried to nurse my son, he was dead! But when I looked more closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn’t my son at all.”",
      "Then the other woman interrupted, “It certainly was your son, and the living child is mine.”\n“No,” the first woman said, “the living child is mine, and the dead one is yours.” And so they argued back and forth before the king.",
      "Then the king said, “Let’s get the facts straight. Both of you claim the living child is yours, and each says that the dead one belongs to the other.",
      "All right, bring me a sword.” So a sword was brought to the king.",
      "Then he said, “Cut the living child in two, and give half to one woman and half to the other!”",
      "Then the woman who was the real mother of the living child, and who loved him very much, cried out, “Oh no, my lord! Give her the child—please do not kill him!”\nBut the other woman said, “All right, he will be neither yours nor mine; divide him between us!”",
      "Then the king said, “Do not kill the child, but give him to the woman who wants him to live, for she is his mother!”",
      "When all Israel heard the king’s decision, the people were in awe of the king, for they saw the wisdom God had given him for rendering justice."

      "King Hiram of Tyre had always been a loyal friend of David. When Hiram learned that David’s son Solomon was the new king of Israel, he sent ambassadors to congratulate him.",

      "“You know that my father, David, was not able to build a Temple to honor the name of the Lord his God because of the many wars waged against him by surrounding nations. He could not build until the Lord gave him victory over all his enemies.",
      "But now the Lord my God has given me peace on every side; I have no enemies, and all is well.",
      "So I am planning to build a Temple to honor the name of the Lord my God, just as he had instructed my father, David. For the Lord told him, ‘Your son, whom I will place on your throne, will build the Temple to honor my name.’",

      "My servants will bring the logs from the Lebanon mountains to the Mediterranean Sea and make them into rafts and float them along the coast to whatever place you choose. Then we will break the rafts apart so you can carry the logs away. You can pay me by supplying me with food for my household.”",
      "So Hiram supplied as much cedar and cypress timber as Solomon desired.",
      "In return, Solomon sent him an annual payment of 100,000 bushels of wheat for his household and 110,000 gallons of pure olive oil.",

      "It was in midspring, in the month of Ziv, during the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, that he began to construct the Temple of the Lord. This was 480 years after the people of Israel were rescued from their slavery in the land of Egypt.",
      "The Temple that King Solomon built for the Lord was 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high.",
      "The entry room at the front of the Temple was 30 feet wide, running across the entire width of the Temple. It projected outward 15 feet from the front of the Temple.",
      "Solomon also made narrow recessed windows throughout the Temple.",
      "He built a complex of rooms against the outer walls of the Temple, all the way around the sides and rear of the building.",
      "The complex was three stories high, the bottom floor being 7 1⁄2 feet wide, the second floor 9 feet wide, and the top floor 10 1⁄2 feet wide. The rooms were connected to the walls of the Temple by beams resting on ledges built out from the wall. So the beams were not inserted into the walls themselves.",
      "The stones used in the construction of the Temple were finished at the quarry, so there was no sound of hammer, ax, or any other iron tool at the building site.",
      "The entrance to the bottom floor was on the south side of the Temple. There were winding stairs going up to the second floor, and another flight of stairs between the second and third floors.",
      "After completing the Temple structure, Solomon put in a ceiling made of cedar beams and planks.",
      "As already stated, he built a complex of rooms along the sides of the building, attached to the Temple walls by cedar timbers. Each story of the complex was 7 1⁄2 feet high.",
      "Then the Lord gave this message to Solomon:",

      "I will live among the Israelites and will never abandon my people Israel.”",

      "For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, he made double doors of wild olive wood with five-sided doorposts.",
      "These double doors were decorated with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. The doors, including the decorations of cherubim and palm trees, were overlaid with gold.",

      "The hall had a cedar roof. Above the beams on the pillars were forty-five side rooms, arranged in three tiers of fifteen each.",
      "On each end of the long hall were three rows of windows facing each other.",
      "All the doorways and doorposts had rectangular frames and were arranged in sets of three, facing each other.",
      "Solomon also built the Hall of Pillars, which was 75 feet long and 45 feet wide. There was a porch in front, along with a canopy supported by pillars.",
      "Solomon also built the throne room, known as the Hall of Justice, where he sat to hear legal matters. It was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling.",
      "Solomon’s living quarters surrounded a courtyard behind this hall, and they were constructed the same way. He also built similar living quarters for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married.",
      "From foundation to eaves, all these buildings were built from huge blocks of high-quality stone, cut with saws and trimmed to exact measure on all sides.",
      "Some of the huge foundation stones were 15 feet long, and some were 12 feet long.",
      "The blocks of high-quality stone used in the walls were also cut to measure, and cedar beams were also used.",

      "King Solomon then asked for a man named Huram to come from Tyre.",
      "He was half Israelite, since his mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father had been a craftsman in bronze from Tyre. Huram was extremely skillful and talented in any work in bronze, and he came to do all the metal work for King Solomon.",
      "Huram cast two bronze pillars, each 27 feet tall and 18 feet in circumference.",
      "For the tops of the pillars he cast bronze capitals, each 7 1⁄2 feet tall.",

      "The capitals on the pillars were shaped like water lilies. And so the work on the pillars was finished.",
      "Then Huram cast a great round basin, 15 feet across from rim to rim, called the Sea. It was 7 1⁄2 feet deep and about 45 feet in circumference.",
      "It was encircled just below its rim by two rows of decorative gourds. There were about six gourds per foot all the way around, and they were cast as part of the basin.",
      "The Sea was placed on a base of twelve bronze oxen, all facing outward. Three faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east, and the Sea rested on them.",
      "The walls of the Sea were about three inches thick, and its rim flared out like a cup and resembled a water lily blossom. It could hold about 11,000 gallons of water.",
      "Huram also made ten bronze water carts, each 6 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 4 1⁄2 feet tall.",
      "They were constructed with side panels braced with crossbars.",
      "Both the panels and the crossbars were decorated with carved lions, oxen, and cherubim. Above and below the lions and oxen were wreath decorations.",

      "The top of each cart had a rounded frame for the basin. It projected 1 1⁄2 feet above the cart’s top like a round pedestal, and its opening was 2 1⁄4 feet across; it was decorated on the outside with carvings of wreaths. The panels of the carts were square, not round.",
      "Under the panels were four wheels that were connected to axles that had been cast as one unit with the cart. The wheels were 2 1⁄4 feet in diameter",

      "There were handles at each of the four corners of the carts, and these, too, were cast as one unit with the cart.",

      "Carvings of cherubim, lions, and palm trees decorated the panels and corner supports wherever there was room, and there were wreaths all around.",
      "All ten water carts were the same size and were made alike, for each was cast from the same mold.",
      "Huram also made ten smaller bronze basins, one for each cart. Each basin was six feet across and could hold 220 gallons of water.",
      "He set five water carts on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side. The great bronze basin called the Sea was placed near the southeast corner of the Temple.",
      "He also made the necessary washbasins, shovels, and bowls.\nSo at last Huram completed everything King Solomon had assigned him to make for the Temple of the Lord:",

      "the ten water carts holding the ten basins;",
      "the Sea and the twelve oxen under it;",
      "the ash buckets, the shovels, and the bowls.\nHuram made all these things of burnished bronze for the Temple of the Lord, just as King Solomon had directed.",
      "The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zarethan.",
      "Solomon did not weigh all these things because there were so many; the weight of the bronze could not be measured.",

He offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of peace offerings there, because the bronze altar in the Lord’s presence was too small to hold all the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.",

      "But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not also a prophet of the Lord here? We should ask him the same question.”",
      "The king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat, “There is one more man who could consult the Lord for us, but I hate him. He never prophesies anything but trouble for me! His name is Micaiah son of Imlah.”\nJehoshaphat replied, “That’s not the way a king should talk! Let’s hear what he has to say.”",
      "So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Quick! Bring Micaiah son of Imlah.”",
      "King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on thrones at the threshing floor near the gate of Samaria. All of Ahab’s prophets were prophesying there in front of them.",
      "One of them, Zedekiah son of Kenaanah, made some iron horns and proclaimed, “This is what the Lord says: With these horns you will gore the Arameans to death!”",
      "All the other prophets agreed. “Yes,” they said, “go up to Ramoth-gilead and be victorious, for the Lord will give the king victory!”",
      "Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah said to him, “Look, all the prophets are promising victory for the king. Be sure that you agree with them and promise success.”",
      "But Micaiah replied, “As surely as the Lord lives, I will say only what the Lord tells me to say.”",
      "When Micaiah arrived before the king, Ahab asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we hold back?”\nMicaiah replied sarcastically, “Yes, go up and be victorious, for the Lord will give the king victory!”",
      "But the king replied sharply, “How many times must I demand that you speak only the truth to me when you speak for the Lord?”",
      "Then Micaiah told him, “In a vision I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said, ‘Their master has been killed. Send them home in peace.’”",
      "“Didn’t I tell you?” the king of Israel exclaimed to Jehoshaphat. “He never prophesies anything but trouble for me.”",
      "Then Micaiah continued, “Listen to what the Lord says! I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the armies of heaven around him, on his right and on his left.",
      "And the Lord said, ‘Who can entice Ahab to go into battle against Ramoth-gilead so he can be killed?’\n“There were many suggestions,",
      "and finally a spirit approached the Lord and said, ‘I can do it!’",
      "“‘How will you do this?’ the Lord asked.\n“And the spirit replied, ‘I will go out and inspire all of Ahab’s prophets to speak lies.’\n“‘You will succeed,’ said the Lord. ‘Go ahead and do it.’",
      "“So you see, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all your prophets. For the Lord has pronounced your doom.”",
      "Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him across the face. “Since when did the Spirit of the Lord leave me to speak to you?” he demanded.",
      "And Micaiah replied, “You will find out soon enough when you are trying to hide in some secret room!”",
      "“Arrest him!” the king of Israel ordered. “Take him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to my son Joash.",
      "Give them this order from the king: ‘Put this man in prison, and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return safely from the battle!’”",
      "But Micaiah replied, “If you return safely, it will mean that the Lord has not spoken through me!” Then he added to those standing around, “Everyone mark my words!”",
      "So King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah led their armies against Ramoth-gilead.",
      "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “As we go into battle, I will disguise myself so no one will recognize me, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.",
      "Meanwhile, the king of Aram had issued these orders to his thirty-two chariot commanders: “Attack only the king of Israel. Don’t bother with anyone else!”",
      "So when the Aramean chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes, they went after him. “There is the king of Israel!” they shouted. But when Jehoshaphat called out,",
      "the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, and they stopped chasing him.",
      "An Aramean soldier, however, randomly shot an arrow at the Israelite troops and hit the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. “Turn the horses and get me out of here!” Ahab groaned to the driver of his chariot. “I’m badly wounded!”",
      "The battle raged all that day, and the king remained propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran down to the floor of his chariot, and as evening arrived he died.",
      "Just as the sun was setting, the cry ran through his troops: “We’re done for! Run for your lives!”",
      "So the king died, and his body was taken to Samaria and buried there.",
      "Then his chariot was washed beside the pool of Samaria, and dogs came and licked his blood at the place where the prostitutes bathed, just as the Lord had promised.",
      "The rest of the events in Ahab’s reign and everything he did, including the story of the ivory palace and the towns he built, are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.",
      "So Ahab died, and his son Ahaziah became the next king.",
      "Jehoshaphat son of Asa began to rule over Judah in the fourth year of King Ahab’s reign in Israel.",
      "Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.",
      "Jehoshaphat was a good king, following the example of his father, Asa. He did what was pleasing in the Lord’s sight. During his reign, however, he failed to remove all the pagan shrines, and the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there.",
      "Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.",
      "The rest of the events in Jehoshaphat’s reign, the extent of his power, and the wars he waged are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.",
      "He banished from the land the rest of the male and female shrine prostitutes, who still continued their practices from the days of his father, Asa.",
      "(There was no king in Edom at that time, only a deputy.)",
      "Jehoshaphat also built a fleet of trading ships to sail to Ophir for gold. But the ships never set sail, for they met with disaster in their home port of Ezion-geber.",
      "At one time Ahaziah son of Ahab had proposed to Jehoshaphat, “Let my men sail with your men in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat refused the request.",
      "When Jehoshaphat died, he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Jehoram became the next king.",
      "Ahaziah son of Ahab began to rule over Israel in the seventeenth year of King Jehoshaphat’s reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria two years.",
      "But he did what was evil in the Lord’s sight, following the example of his father and mother and the example of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had led Israel to sin.",
      "He served Baal and worshiped him, provoking the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, just as his father had done."
