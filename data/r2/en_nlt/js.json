      "After the death of Moses the Lord’s servant, the Lord spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant. He said,",
      "“Moses my servant is dead. Therefore, the time has come for you to lead these people, the Israelites, across the Jordan River into the land I am giving them.",
      "I promise you what I promised Moses: ‘Wherever you set foot, you will be on land I have given you—",
      "from the Negev wilderness in the south to the Lebanon mountains in the north, from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, including all the land of the Hittites.’",
      "No one will be able to stand against you as long as you live. For I will be with you as I was with Moses. I will not fail you or abandon you.",
      "“Be strong and courageous, for you are the one who will lead these people to possess all the land I swore to their ancestors I would give them.",
      "Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the instructions Moses gave you. Do not deviate from them, turning either to the right or to the left. Then you will be successful in everything you do.",
      "Study this Book of Instruction continually. Meditate on it day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in it. Only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do.",
      "This is my command—be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.”",
      "Joshua then commanded the officers of Israel,",
      "“Go through the camp and tell the people to get their provisions ready. In three days you will cross the Jordan River and take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you.”",
      "Then Joshua called together the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. He told them,",
      "“Remember what Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you: ‘The Lord your God is giving you a place of rest. He has given you this land.’",
      "Your wives, children, and livestock may remain here in the land Moses assigned to you on the east side of the Jordan River. But your strong warriors, fully armed, must lead the other tribes across the Jordan to help them conquer their territory. Stay with them",
      "until the Lord gives them rest, as he has given you rest, and until they, too, possess the land the Lord your God is giving them. Only then may you return and settle here on the east side of the Jordan River in the land that Moses, the servant of the Lord, assigned to you.”",
      "They answered Joshua, “We will do whatever you command us, and we will go wherever you send us.",
      "We will obey you just as we obeyed Moses. And may the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses.",
      "Anyone who rebels against your orders and does not obey your words and everything you command will be put to death. So be strong and courageous!”"

      "Then Joshua secretly sent out two spies from the Israelite camp at Acacia Grove. He instructed them, “Scout out the land on the other side of the Jordan River, especially around Jericho.” So the two men set out and came to the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there that night.",
      "But someone told the king of Jericho, “Some Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.”",
      "So the king of Jericho sent orders to Rahab: “Bring out the men who have come into your house, for they have come here to spy out the whole land.”",
      "Rahab had hidden the two men, but she replied, “Yes, the men were here earlier, but I didn’t know where they were from.",
      "They left the town at dusk, as the gates were about to close. I don’t know where they went. If you hurry, you can probably catch up with them.”",
      "(Actually, she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them beneath bundles of flax she had laid out.)",
      "So the king’s men went looking for the spies along the road leading to the shallow crossings of the Jordan River. And as soon as the king’s men had left, the gate of Jericho was shut.",
      "Before the spies went to sleep that night, Rahab went up on the roof to talk with them.",
      "“I know the Lord has given you this land,” she told them. “We are all afraid of you. Everyone in the land is living in terror.",
      "For we have heard how the Lord made a dry path for you through the Red Sea when you left Egypt. And we know what you did to Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River, whose people you completely destroyed.",
      "No wonder our hearts have melted in fear! No one has the courage to fight after hearing such things. For the Lord your God is the supreme God of the heavens above and the earth below.",
      "“Now swear to me by the Lord that you will be kind to me and my family since I have helped you. Give me some guarantee that",
      "when Jericho is conquered, you will let me live, along with my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all their families.”",
      "“We offer our own lives as a guarantee for your safety,” the men agreed. “If you don’t betray us, we will keep our promise and be kind to you when the Lord gives us the land.”",
      "Then, since Rahab’s house was built into the town wall, she let them down by a rope through the window.",
      "“Escape to the hill country,” she told them. “Hide there for three days from the men searching for you. Then, when they have returned, you can go on your way.”",
      "Before they left, the men told her, “We will be bound by the oath we have taken only if you follow these instructions.",
      "When we come into the land, you must leave this scarlet rope hanging from the window through which you let us down. And all your family members—your father, mother, brothers, and all your relatives—must be here inside the house.",
      "If they go out into the street and are killed, it will not be our fault. But if anyone lays a hand on people inside this house, we will accept the responsibility for their death.",
      "If you betray us, however, we are not bound by this oath in any way.”",
      "“I accept your terms,” she replied. And she sent them on their way, leaving the scarlet rope hanging from the window.",
      "The spies went up into the hill country and stayed there three days. The men who were chasing them searched everywhere along the road, but they finally returned without success.",
      "Then the two spies came down from the hill country, crossed the Jordan River, and reported to Joshua all that had happened to them.",
      "“The Lord has given us the whole land,” they said, “for all the people in the land are terrified of us.”"

      "Early the next morning Joshua and all the Israelites left Acacia Grove and arrived at the banks of the Jordan River, where they camped before crossing.",
      "Three days later the Israelite officers went through the camp,",
      "giving these instructions to the people: “When you see the Levitical priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, move out from your positions and follow them.",
      "Since you have never traveled this way before, they will guide you. Stay about half a mile behind them, keeping a clear distance between you and the Ark. Make sure you don’t come any closer.”",
      "Then Joshua told the people, “Purify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do great wonders among you.”",
      "In the morning Joshua said to the priests, “Lift up the Ark of the Covenant and lead the people across the river.” And so they started out and went ahead of the people.",
      "The Lord told Joshua, “Today I will begin to make you a great leader in the eyes of all the Israelites. They will know that I am with you, just as I was with Moses.",
      "Give this command to the priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant: ‘When you reach the banks of the Jordan River, take a few steps into the river and stop there.’”",
      "So Joshua told the Israelites, “Come and listen to what the Lord your God says.",
      "Today you will know that the living God is among you. He will surely drive out the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites ahead of you.",
      "Look, the Ark of the Covenant, which belongs to the Lord of the whole earth, will lead you across the Jordan River!",
      "Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.",
      "The priests will carry the Ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth. As soon as their feet touch the water, the flow of water will be cut off upstream, and the river will stand up like a wall.”",
      "So the people left their camp to cross the Jordan, and the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant went ahead of them.",
      "It was the harvest season, and the Jordan was overflowing its banks. But as soon as the feet of the priests who were carrying the Ark touched the water at the river’s edge,",
      "the water above that point began backing up a great distance away at a town called Adam, which is near Zarethan. And the water below that point flowed on to the Dead Sea until the riverbed was dry. Then all the people crossed over near the town of Jericho.",
      "Meanwhile, the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant stood on dry ground in the middle of the riverbed as the people passed by. They waited there until the whole nation of Israel had crossed the Jordan on dry ground."
    ],
    [
      "When all the people had crossed the Jordan, the Lord said to Joshua,",
      "“Now choose twelve men, one from each tribe.",
      "Tell them, ‘Take twelve stones from the very place where the priests are standing in the middle of the Jordan. Carry them out and pile them up at the place where you will camp tonight.’”",
      "So Joshua called together the twelve men he had chosen—one from each of the tribes of Israel.",
      "He told them, “Go into the middle of the Jordan, in front of the Ark of the Lord your God. Each of you must pick up one stone and carry it out on your shoulder—twelve stones in all, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel.",
      "We will use these stones to build a memorial. In the future your children will ask you, ‘What do these stones mean?’",
      "Then you can tell them, ‘They remind us that the Jordan River stopped flowing when the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant went across.’ These stones will stand as a memorial among the people of Israel forever.”",
      "So the men did as Joshua had commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan River, one for each tribe, just as the Lord had told Joshua. They carried them to the place where they camped for the night and constructed the memorial there.",
      "Joshua also set up another pile of twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, at the place where the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant were standing. And they are there to this day.",
      "The priests who were carrying the Ark stood in the middle of the river until all of the Lord’s commands that Moses had given to Joshua were carried out. Meanwhile, the people hurried across the riverbed.",
      "And when everyone was safely on the other side, the priests crossed over with the Ark of the Lord as the people watched.",
      "The armed warriors from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh led the Israelites across the Jordan, just as Moses had directed.",
      "These armed men—about 40,000 strong—were ready for battle, and the Lord was with them as they crossed over to the plains of Jericho.",
      "That day the Lord made Joshua a great leader in the eyes of all the Israelites, and for the rest of his life they revered him as much as they had revered Moses.",
      "The Lord had said to Joshua,",
      "“Command the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant to come up out of the riverbed.”",
      "So Joshua gave the command.",
      "As soon as the priests carrying the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant came up out of the riverbed and their feet were on high ground, the water of the Jordan returned and overflowed its banks as before.",
      "The people crossed the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month. Then they camped at Gilgal, just east of Jericho.",
      "It was there at Gilgal that Joshua piled up the twelve stones taken from the Jordan River.",
      "Then Joshua said to the Israelites, “In the future your children will ask, ‘What do these stones mean?’",
      "Then you can tell them, ‘This is where the Israelites crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’",
      "For the Lord your God dried up the river right before your eyes, and he kept it dry until you were all across, just as he did at the Red Sea when he dried it up until we had all crossed over.",
      "He did this so all the nations of the earth might know that the Lord’s hand is powerful, and so you might fear the Lord your God forever.”"
    ],
    [
      "When all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings who lived along the Mediterranean coast heard how the Lord had dried up the Jordan River so the people of Israel could cross, they lost heart and were paralyzed with fear because of them.",
      "At that time the Lord told Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise this second generation of Israelites.”",
      "So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the entire male population of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.",
      "Joshua had to circumcise them because all the men who were old enough to fight in battle when they left Egypt had died in the wilderness.",
      "Those who left Egypt had all been circumcised, but none of those born after the Exodus, during the years in the wilderness, had been circumcised.",
      "The Israelites had traveled in the wilderness for forty years until all the men who were old enough to fight in battle when they left Egypt had died. For they had disobeyed the Lord, and the Lord vowed he would not let them enter the land he had sworn to give us—a land flowing with milk and honey.",
      "So Joshua circumcised their sons—those who had grown up to take their fathers’ places—for they had not been circumcised on the way to the Promised Land.",
      "After all the males had been circumcised, they rested in the camp until they were healed.",
      "Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the shame of your slavery in Egypt.” So that place has been called Gilgal to this day.",
      "While the Israelites were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they celebrated Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month.",
      "The very next day they began to eat unleavened bread and roasted grain harvested from the land.",
      "No manna appeared on the day they first ate from the crops of the land, and it was never seen again. So from that time on the Israelites ate from the crops of Canaan.",
      "When Joshua was near the town of Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with sword in hand. Joshua went up to him and demanded, “Are you friend or foe?”",
      "“Neither one,” he replied. “I am the commander of the Lord’s army.”\nAt this, Joshua fell with his face to the ground in reverence. “I am at your command,” Joshua said. “What do you want your servant to do?”",
      "The commander of the Lord’s army replied, “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did as he was told."

    [
      "Now the gates of Jericho were tightly shut because the people were afraid of the Israelites. No one was allowed to go out or in.",
      "But the Lord said to Joshua, “I have given you Jericho, its king, and all its strong warriors.",
      "You and your fighting men should march around the town once a day for six days.",
      "Seven priests will walk ahead of the Ark, each carrying a ram’s horn. On the seventh day you are to march around the town seven times, with the priests blowing the horns.",
      "When you hear the priests give one long blast on the rams’ horns, have all the people shout as loud as they can. Then the walls of the town will collapse, and the people can charge straight into the town.”",
      "So Joshua called together the priests and said, “Take up the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant, and assign seven priests to walk in front of it, each carrying a ram’s horn.”",
      "Then he gave orders to the people: “March around the town, and the armed men will lead the way in front of the Ark of the Lord.”",
      "After Joshua spoke to the people, the seven priests with the rams’ horns started marching in the presence of the Lord, blowing the horns as they marched. And the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant followed behind them.",
      "Some of the armed men marched in front of the priests with the horns and some behind the Ark, with the priests continually blowing the horns.",
      "“Do not shout; do not even talk,” Joshua commanded. “Not a single word from any of you until I tell you to shout. Then shout!”",
      "So the Ark of the Lord was carried around the town once that day, and then everyone returned to spend the night in the camp.",
      "Joshua got up early the next morning, and the priests again carried the Ark of the Lord.",
      "The seven priests with the rams’ horns marched in front of the Ark of the Lord, blowing their horns. Again the armed men marched both in front of the priests with the horns and behind the Ark of the Lord. All this time the priests were blowing their horns.",
      "On the second day they again marched around the town once and returned to the camp. They followed this pattern for six days.",
      "On the seventh day the Israelites got up at dawn and marched around the town as they had done before. But this time they went around the town seven times.",
      "The seventh time around, as the priests sounded the long blast on their horns, Joshua commanded the people, “Shout! For the Lord has given you the town!",
      "Jericho and everything in it must be completely destroyed as an offering to the Lord. Only Rahab the prostitute and the others in her house will be spared, for she protected our spies.",
      "“Do not take any of the things set apart for destruction, or you yourselves will be completely destroyed, and you will bring trouble on the camp of Israel.",
      "Everything made from silver, gold, bronze, or iron is sacred to the Lord and must be brought into his treasury.”",
      "When the people heard the sound of the rams’ horns, they shouted as loud as they could. Suddenly, the walls of Jericho collapsed, and the Israelites charged straight into the town and captured it.",
      "They completely destroyed everything in it with their swords—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep, goats, and donkeys.",
      "Meanwhile, Joshua said to the two spies, “Keep your promise. Go to the prostitute’s house and bring her out, along with all her family.”",
      "The men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers, and all the other relatives who were with her. They moved her whole family to a safe place near the camp of Israel.",
      "Then the Israelites burned the town and everything in it. Only the things made from silver, gold, bronze, or iron were kept for the treasury of the Lord’s house.",
      "So Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute and her relatives who were with her in the house, because she had hidden the spies Joshua sent to Jericho. And she lives among the Israelites to this day.",
      "At that time Joshua invoked this curse:\n“May the curse of the Lord fall on anyone\n    who tries to rebuild the town of Jericho.\nAt the cost of his firstborn son,\n    he will lay its foundation.\nAt the cost of his youngest son,\n    he will set up its gates.”",
      "So the Lord was with Joshua, and his reputation spread throughout the land."
    ],
    [
      "But Israel violated the instructions about the things set apart for the Lord. A man named Achan had stolen some of these dedicated things, so the Lord was very angry with the Israelites. Achan was the son of Carmi, a descendant of Zimri son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah.",
      "Joshua sent some of his men from Jericho to spy out the town of Ai, east of Bethel, near Beth-aven.",
      "When they returned, they told Joshua, “There’s no need for all of us to go up there; it won’t take more than two or three thousand men to attack Ai. Since there are so few of them, don’t make all our people struggle to go up there.”",
      "So approximately 3,000 warriors were sent, but they were soundly defeated. The men of Ai",
      "chased the Israelites from the town gate as far as the quarries, and they killed about thirty-six who were retreating down the slope. The Israelites were paralyzed with fear at this turn of events, and their courage melted away.",
      "Joshua and the elders of Israel tore their clothing in dismay, threw dust on their heads, and bowed face down to the ground before the Ark of the Lord until evening.",
      "Then Joshua cried out, “Oh, Sovereign Lord, why did you bring us across the Jordan River if you are going to let the Amorites kill us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side!",
      "Lord, what can I say now that Israel has fled from its enemies?",
      "For when the Canaanites and all the other people living in the land hear about it, they will surround us and wipe our name off the face of the earth. And then what will happen to the honor of your great name?”",
      "But the Lord said to Joshua, “Get up! Why are you lying on your face like this?",
      "Israel has sinned and broken my covenant! They have stolen some of the things that I commanded must be set apart for me. And they have not only stolen them but have lied about it and hidden the things among their own belongings.",
      "That is why the Israelites are running from their enemies in defeat. For now Israel itself has been set apart for destruction. I will not remain with you any longer unless you destroy the things among you that were set apart for destruction.",
      "“Get up! Command the people to purify themselves in preparation for tomorrow. For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Hidden among you, O Israel, are things set apart for the Lord. You will never defeat your enemies until you remove these things from among you.",
      "“In the morning you must present yourselves by tribes, and the Lord will point out the tribe to which the guilty man belongs. That tribe must come forward with its clans, and the Lord will point out the guilty clan. That clan will then come forward, and the Lord will point out the guilty family. Finally, each member of the guilty family must come forward one by one.",
      "The one who has stolen what was set apart for destruction will himself be burned with fire, along with everything he has, for he has broken the covenant of the Lord and has done a horrible thing in Israel.”",
      "Early the next morning Joshua brought the tribes of Israel before the Lord, and the tribe of Judah was singled out.",
      "Then the clans of Judah came forward, and the clan of Zerah was singled out. Then the families of Zerah came forward, and the family of Zimri was singled out.",
      "Every member of Zimri’s family was brought forward person by person, and Achan was singled out.",
      "Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, by telling the truth. Make your confession and tell me what you have done. Don’t hide it from me.”",
      "Achan replied, “It is true! I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel.",
      "Among the plunder I saw a beautiful robe from Babylon, 200 silver coins, and a bar of gold weighing more than a pound. I wanted them so much that I took them. They are hidden in the ground beneath my tent, with the silver buried deeper than the rest.”",
      "So Joshua sent some men to make a search. They ran to the tent and found the stolen goods hidden there, just as Achan had said, with the silver buried beneath the rest.",
      "They took the things from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites. Then they laid them on the ground in the presence of the Lord.",
      "Then Joshua and all the Israelites took Achan, the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons, daughters, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, tent, and everything he had, and they brought them to the valley of Achor.",
      "Then Joshua said to Achan, “Why have you brought trouble on us? The Lord will now bring trouble on you.” And all the Israelites stoned Achan and his family and burned their bodies.",
      "They piled a great heap of stones over Achan, which remains to this day. That is why the place has been called the Valley of Trouble ever since. So the Lord was no longer angry."

      "Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid or discouraged. Take all your fighting men and attack Ai, for I have given you the king of Ai, his people, his town, and his land.",
      "You will destroy them as you destroyed Jericho and its king. But this time you may keep the plunder and the livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the town.”",
      "So Joshua and all the fighting men set out to attack Ai. Joshua chose 30,000 of his best warriors and sent them out at night",
      "with these orders: “Hide in ambush close behind the town and be ready for action.",
      "When our main army attacks, the men of Ai will come out to fight as they did before, and we will run away from them.",
      "We will let them chase us until we have drawn them away from the town. For they will say, ‘The Israelites are running away from us as they did before.’ Then, while we are running from them,",
      "you will jump up from your ambush and take possession of the town, for the Lord your God will give it to you.",
      "Set the town on fire, as the Lord has commanded. You have your orders.”",
      "So they left and went to the place of ambush between Bethel and the west side of Ai. But Joshua remained among the people in the camp that night.",
      "Early the next morning Joshua roused his men and started toward Ai, accompanied by the elders of Israel.",
      "All the fighting men who were with Joshua marched in front of the town and camped on the north side of Ai, with a valley between them and the town.",
      "That night Joshua sent about 5,000 men to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the town.",
      "So they stationed the main army north of the town and the ambush west of the town. Joshua himself spent that night in the valley.",
      "When the king of Ai saw the Israelites across the valley, he and all his army hurried out early in the morning and attacked the Israelites at a place overlooking the Jordan Valley. But he didn’t realize there was an ambush behind the town.",
      "Joshua and the Israelite army fled toward the wilderness as though they were badly beaten.",
      "Then all the men in the town were called out to chase after them. In this way, they were lured away from the town.",
      "There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who did not chase after the Israelites, and the town was left wide open.",
      "Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Point the spear in your hand toward Ai, for I will hand the town over to you.” Joshua did as he was commanded.",
      "As soon as Joshua gave this signal, all the men in ambush jumped up from their position and poured into the town. They quickly captured it and set it on fire.",
      "When the men of Ai looked behind them, smoke from the town was filling the sky, and they had nowhere to go. For the Israelites who had fled in the direction of the wilderness now turned on their pursuers.",
      "When Joshua and all the other Israelites saw that the ambush had succeeded and that smoke was rising from the town, they turned and attacked the men of Ai.",
      "Meanwhile, the Israelites who were inside the town came out and attacked the enemy from the rear. So the men of Ai were caught in the middle, with Israelite fighters on both sides. Israel attacked them, and not a single person survived or escaped.",
      "Only the king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua.",
      "When the Israelite army finished chasing and killing all the men of Ai in the open fields, they went back and finished off everyone inside.",
      "So the entire population of Ai, including men and women, was wiped out that day—12,000 in all.",
      "For Joshua kept holding out his spear until everyone who had lived in Ai was completely destroyed.",
      "Only the livestock and the treasures of the town were not destroyed, for the Israelites kept these as plunder for themselves, as the Lord had commanded Joshua.",
      "So Joshua burned the town of Ai, and it became a permanent mound of ruins, desolate to this very day.",
      "Joshua impaled the king of Ai on a sharpened pole and left him there until evening. At sunset the Israelites took down the body, as Joshua commanded, and threw it in front of the town gate. They piled a great heap of stones over him that can still be seen today.",
      "Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal.",
      "He followed the commands that Moses the Lord’s servant had written in the Book of Instruction: “Make me an altar from stones that are uncut and have not been shaped with iron tools.” Then on the altar they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings to the Lord.",
      "And as the Israelites watched, Joshua copied onto the stones of the altar the instructions Moses had given them.",
      "Then all the Israelites—foreigners and native-born alike—along with the elders, officers, and judges, were divided into two groups. One group stood in front of Mount Gerizim, the other in front of Mount Ebal. Each group faced the other, and between them stood the Levitical priests carrying the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant. This was all done according to the commands that Moses, the servant of the Lord, had previously given for blessing the people of Israel.",
      "Joshua then read to them all the blessings and curses Moses had written in the Book of Instruction.",
      "Every word of every command that Moses had ever given was read to the entire assembly of Israel, including the women and children and the foreigners who lived among them."

      "Now all the kings west of the Jordan River heard about what had happened. These were the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who lived in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea as far north as the Lebanon mountains.",
      "These kings combined their armies to fight as one against Joshua and the Israelites.",
      "But when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,",

      "Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, replied to them, “Today we know the Lord is among us because you have not committed this treachery against the Lord as we thought. Instead, you have rescued Israel from being destroyed by the hand of the Lord.”",
      "Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the other leaders left the tribes of Reuben and Gad in Gilead and returned to the land of Canaan to tell the Israelites what had happened.",
      "And all the Israelites were satisfied and praised God and spoke no more of war against Reuben and Gad.",
      "The people of Reuben and Gad named the altar “Witness,” for they said, “It is a witness between us and them that the Lord is our God, too.”"

      "The years passed, and the Lord had given the people of Israel rest from all their enemies. Joshua, who was now very old,",
      "called together all the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of Israel. He said to them, “I am now a very old man.",
      "You have seen everything the Lord your God has done for you during my lifetime. The Lord your God has fought for you against your enemies.",
      "I have allotted to you as your homeland all the land of the nations yet unconquered, as well as the land of those we have already conquered—from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.",
      "This land will be yours, for the Lord your God will himself drive out all the people living there now. You will take possession of their land, just as the Lord your God promised you.",
      "“So be very careful to follow everything Moses wrote in the Book of Instruction. Do not deviate from it, turning either to the right or to the left.",
      "Make sure you do not associate with the other people still remaining in the land. Do not even mention the names of their gods, much less swear by them or serve them or worship them.",
      "Rather, cling tightly to the Lord your God as you have done until now.",
      "“For the Lord has driven out great and powerful nations for you, and no one has yet been able to defeat you.",
      "Each one of you will put to flight a thousand of the enemy, for the Lord your God fights for you, just as he has promised.",
      "So be very careful to love the Lord your God.",
      "“But if you turn away from him and cling to the customs of the survivors of these nations remaining among you, and if you intermarry with them,",
      "then know for certain that the Lord your God will no longer drive them out of your land. Instead, they will be a snare and a trap to you, a whip for your backs and thorny brambles in your eyes, and you will vanish from this good land the Lord your God has given you.",
      "“Soon I will die, going the way of everything on earth. Deep in your hearts you know that every promise of the Lord your God has come true. Not a single one has failed!",
      "But as surely as the Lord your God has given you the good things he promised, he will also bring disaster on you if you disobey him. He will completely destroy you from this good land he has given you.",
      "If you break the covenant of the Lord your God by worshiping and serving other gods, his anger will burn against you, and you will quickly vanish from the good land he has given you.”"

      "I gave you land you had not worked on, and I gave you towns you did not build—the towns where you are now living. I gave you vineyards and olive groves for food, though you did not plant them.",
      "“So fear the Lord and serve him wholeheartedly. Put away forever the idols your ancestors worshiped when they lived beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt. Serve the Lord alone.",
