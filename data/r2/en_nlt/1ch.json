      "The people rejoiced over the offerings, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the Lord, and King David was filled with joy.",
      "Then David praised the Lord in the presence of the whole assembly:\n“O Lord, the God of our ancestor Israel, may you be praised forever and ever!",
      "Yours, O Lord, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty. Everything in the heavens and on earth is yours, O Lord, and this is your kingdom. We adore you as the one who is over all things.",
      "Wealth and honor come from you alone, for you rule over everything. Power and might are in your hand, and at your discretion people are made great and given strength.",

      "But who am I, and who are my people, that we could give anything to you? Everything we have has come from you, and we give you only what you first gave us!",
      "We are here for only a moment, visitors and strangers in the land as our ancestors were before us. Our days on earth are like a passing shadow, gone so soon without a trace.",
      "“O Lord our God, even this material we have gathered to build a Temple to honor your holy name comes from you! It all belongs to you!",
      "I know, my God, that you examine our hearts and rejoice when you find integrity there. You know I have done all this with good motives, and I have watched your people offer their gifts willingly and joyously.",
      "“O Lord, the God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, make your people always want to obey you. See to it that their love for you never changes.",
      "Give my son Solomon the wholehearted desire to obey all your commands, laws, and decrees, and to do everything necessary to build this Temple, for which I have made these preparations.”",
      "Then David said to the whole assembly, “Give praise to the Lord your God!” And the entire assembly praised the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and they bowed low and knelt before the Lord and the king.",
      "The next day they brought 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 male lambs as burnt offerings to the Lord. They also brought liquid offerings and many other sacrifices on behalf of all Israel.",
