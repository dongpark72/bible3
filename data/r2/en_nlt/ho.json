      "The Lord gave this message to Hosea son of Beeri during the years when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah, and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel.",
      "When the Lord first began speaking to Israel through Hosea, he said to him, “Go and marry a prostitute, so that some of her children will be conceived in prostitution. This will illustrate how Israel has acted like a prostitute by turning against the Lord and worshiping other gods.”",
      "So Hosea married Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she became pregnant and gave Hosea a son.",
      "And the Lord said, “Name the child Jezreel, for I am about to punish King Jehu’s dynasty to avenge the murders he committed at Jezreel. In fact, I will bring an end to Israel’s independence.",
      "I will break its military power in the Jezreel Valley.”",
      "Soon Gomer became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter. And the Lord said to Hosea, “Name your daughter Lo-ruhamah—‘Not loved’—for I will no longer show love to the people of Israel or forgive them.",
      "But I will show love to the people of Judah. I will free them from their enemies—not with weapons and armies or horses and charioteers, but by my power as the Lord their God.”",
      "After Gomer had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she again became pregnant and gave birth to a second son.",
      "And the Lord said, “Name him Lo-ammi—‘Not my people’—for Israel is not my people, and I am not their God.",
      "“Yet the time will come when Israel’s people will be like the sands of the seashore—too many to count! Then, at the place where they were told, ‘You are not my people,’ it will be said, ‘You are children of the living God.’",
      "Then the people of Judah and Israel will unite together. They will choose one leader for themselves, and they will return from exile together. What a day that will be—the day of Jezreel—when God will again plant his people in his land."

      "“But now bring charges against Israel—your mother—\n    for she is no longer my wife,\n    and I am no longer her husband.\nTell her to remove the prostitute’s makeup from her face\n    and the clothing that exposes her breasts.",
      "Otherwise, I will strip her as naked\n    as she was on the day she was born.\nI will leave her to die of thirst,\n    as in a dry and barren wilderness.",
      "And I will not love her children,\n    for they were conceived in prostitution.",
      "Their mother is a shameless prostitute\n    and became pregnant in a shameful way.\nShe said, ‘I’ll run after other lovers\n    and sell myself to them for food and water,\nfor clothing of wool and linen,\n    and for olive oil and drinks.’",
      "“For this reason I will fence her in with thornbushes.\n    I will block her path with a wall\n    to make her lose her way.",
      "When she runs after her lovers,\n    she won’t be able to catch them.\nShe will search for them\n    but not find them.\nThen she will think,\n‘I might as well return to my husband,\n    for I was better off with him than I am now.’",
      "She doesn’t realize it was I who gave her everything she has—\n    the grain, the new wine, the olive oil;\nI even gave her silver and gold.\n    But she gave all my gifts to Baal.",
      "“But now I will take back the ripened grain and new wine\n    I generously provided each harvest season.\nI will take away the wool and linen clothing\n    I gave her to cover her nakedness.",
      "I will strip her naked in public,\n    while all her lovers look on.\nNo one will be able\n    to rescue her from my hands.",
      "I will put an end to her annual festivals,\n    her new moon celebrations, and her Sabbath days—\n    all her appointed festivals.",
      "I will destroy her grapevines and fig trees,\n    things she claims her lovers gave her.\nI will let them grow into tangled thickets,\n    where only wild animals will eat the fruit.",
      "I will punish her for all those times\n    when she burned incense to her images of Baal,\nwhen she put on her earrings and jewels\n    and went out to look for her lovers\nbut forgot all about me,”\n    says the Lord.",
      "“But then I will win her back once again.\n    I will lead her into the desert\n    and speak tenderly to her there.",
      "I will return her vineyards to her\n    and transform the Valley of Trouble into a gateway of hope.\nShe will give herself to me there,\n    as she did long ago when she was young,\n    when I freed her from her captivity in Egypt.",
      "When that day comes,” says the Lord,\n    “you will call me ‘my husband’\n    instead of ‘my master.’",
      "O Israel, I will wipe the many names of Baal from your lips,\n    and you will never mention them again.",
      "On that day I will make a covenant\n    with all the wild animals and the birds of the sky\nand the animals that scurry along the ground\n    so they will not harm you.\nI will remove all weapons of war from the land,\n    all swords and bows,\nso you can live unafraid\n    in peace and safety.",
      "I will make you my wife forever,\n    showing you righteousness and justice,\n    unfailing love and compassion.",
      "I will be faithful to you and make you mine,\n    and you will finally know me as the Lord.",
      "“In that day, I will answer,”\n    says the Lord.\n“I will answer the sky as it pleads for clouds.\n    And the sky will answer the earth with rain.",
      "Then the earth will answer the thirsty cries\n    of the grain, the grapevines, and the olive trees.\nAnd they in turn will answer,\n    ‘Jezreel’—‘God plants!’",
      "At that time I will plant a crop of Israelites\n    and raise them for myself.\nI will show love\n    to those I called ‘Not loved.’\nAnd to those I called ‘Not my people,’\n    I will say, ‘Now you are my people.’\nAnd they will reply, ‘You are our God!’”"

      "Then the Lord said to me, “Go and love your wife again, even though she commits adultery with another lover. This will illustrate that the Lord still loves Israel, even though the people have turned to other gods and love to worship them.”",
      "So I bought her back for fifteen pieces of silver and five bushels of barley and a measure of wine.",
      "Then I said to her, “You must live in my house for many days and stop your prostitution. During this time, you will not have sexual relations with anyone, not even with me.”",
      "This shows that Israel will go a long time without a king or prince, and without sacrifices, sacred pillars, priests, or even idols!",
