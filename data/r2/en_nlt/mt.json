      "Joseph, to whom she was engaged, was a righteous man and did not want to disgrace her publicly, so he decided to break the engagement quietly.",
      "As he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. “Joseph, son of David,” the angel said, “do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For the child within her was conceived by the Holy Spirit.",
      "And she will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”",
      "All of this occurred to fulfill the Lord’s message through his prophet:",

      "Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the reign of King Herod. About that time some wise men from eastern lands arrived in Jerusalem, asking,",
      "“Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star as it rose, and we have come to worship him.”",
      "King Herod was deeply disturbed when he heard this, as was everyone in Jerusalem.",
      "He called a meeting of the leading priests and teachers of religious law and asked, “Where is the Messiah supposed to be born?”",
      "“In Bethlehem in Judea,” they said, “for this is what the prophet wrote:",
      "‘And you, O Bethlehem in the land of Judah,\n    are not least among the ruling cities of Judah,\nfor a ruler will come from you\n    who will be the shepherd for my people Israel.’”",
      "Then Herod called for a private meeting with the wise men, and he learned from them the time when the star first appeared.",
      "Then he told them, “Go to Bethlehem and search carefully for the child. And when you find him, come back and tell me so that I can go and worship him, too!”",
      "After this interview the wise men went their way. And the star they had seen in the east guided them to Bethlehem. It went ahead of them and stopped over the place where the child was.",
      "When they saw the star, they were filled with joy!",
      "They entered the house and saw the child with his mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.",
      "When it was time to leave, they returned to their own country by another route, for God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod.",
      "After the wise men were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up! Flee to Egypt with the child and his mother,” the angel said. “Stay there until I tell you to return, because Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”",
      "That night Joseph left for Egypt with the child and Mary, his mother,",
      "and they stayed there until Herod’s death. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: “I called my Son out of Egypt.”",
      "Herod was furious when he realized that the wise men had outwitted him. He sent soldiers to kill all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, based on the wise men’s report of the star’s first appearance.",
      "Herod’s brutal action fulfilled what God had spoken through the prophet Jeremiah:",
      "“A cry was heard in Ramah—\n    weeping and great mourning.\nRachel weeps for her children,\n    refusing to be comforted,\n    for they are dead.”",
      "When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.",
      "“Get up!” the angel said. “Take the child and his mother back to the land of Israel, because those who were trying to kill the child are dead.”",
      "So Joseph got up and returned to the land of Israel with Jesus and his mother.",
      "But when he learned that the new ruler of Judea was Herod’s son Archelaus, he was afraid to go there. Then, after being warned in a dream, he left for the region of Galilee.",

      "In those days John the Baptist came to the Judean wilderness and began preaching. His message was,",
      "“Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near.”",
      "The prophet Isaiah was speaking about John when he said,\n“He is a voice shouting in the wilderness,\n‘Prepare the way for the Lord’s coming!\n    Clear the road for him!’”",
      "John’s clothes were woven from coarse camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food he ate locusts and wild honey.",
      "People from Jerusalem and from all of Judea and all over the Jordan Valley went out to see and hear John.",
      "And when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.",
      "But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to watch him baptize, he denounced them. “You brood of snakes!” he exclaimed. “Who warned you to flee the coming wrath?",
      "Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God.",
      "Don’t just say to each other, ‘We’re safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.’ That means nothing, for I tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these very stones.",
      "Even now the ax of God’s judgment is poised, ready to sever the roots of the trees. Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.",
      "“I baptize with water those who repent of their sins and turn to God. But someone is coming soon who is greater than I am—so much greater that I’m not worthy even to be his slave and carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.",
      "He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire.”",
      "Then Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.",
      "But John tried to talk him out of it. “I am the one who needs to be baptized by you,” he said, “so why are you coming to me?”",
      "But Jesus said, “It should be done, for we must carry out all that God requires.” So John agreed to baptize him.",
      "After his baptism, as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and settling on him.",
      "And a voice from heaven said, “This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy.”"
    ],
    [
      "Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted there by the devil.",
      "For forty days and forty nights he fasted and became very hungry.",
      "During that time the devil came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”",
      "But Jesus told him, “No! The Scriptures say,\n‘People do not live by bread alone,\n    but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”",
      "Then the devil took him to the holy city, Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple,",
      "and said, “If you are the Son of God, jump off! For the Scriptures say,\n‘He will order his angels to protect you.\nAnd they will hold you up with their hands\n    so you won’t even hurt your foot on a stone.’”",
      "Jesus responded, “The Scriptures also say, ‘You must not test the Lord your God.’”",
      "Next the devil took him to the peak of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.",
      "“I will give it all to you,” he said, “if you will kneel down and worship me.”",
      "“Get out of here, Satan,” Jesus told him. “For the Scriptures say,\n‘You must worship the Lord your God\n    and serve only him.’”",
      "Then the devil went away, and angels came and took care of Jesus.",
      "When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he left Judea and returned to Galilee.",
      "He went first to Nazareth, then left there and moved to Capernaum, beside the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.",
      "This fulfilled what God said through the prophet Isaiah:",
      "“In the land of Zebulun and of Naphtali,\n    beside the sea, beyond the Jordan River,\n    in Galilee where so many Gentiles live,",
      "the people who sat in darkness\n    have seen a great light.\nAnd for those who lived in the land where death casts its shadow,\n    a light has shined.”",
      "From then on Jesus began to preach, “Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near.”",
      "One day as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers—Simon, also called Peter, and Andrew—throwing a net into the water, for they fished for a living.",
      "Jesus called out to them, “Come, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people!”",
      "And they left their nets at once and followed him.",
      "A little farther up the shore he saw two other brothers, James and John, sitting in a boat with their father, Zebedee, repairing their nets. And he called them to come, too.",
      "They immediately followed him, leaving the boat and their father behind.",
      "Jesus traveled throughout the region of Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom. And he healed every kind of disease and illness.",
      "News about him spread as far as Syria, and people soon began bringing to him all who were sick. And whatever their sickness or disease, or if they were demon possessed or epileptic or paralyzed—he healed them all.",
      "Large crowds followed him wherever he went—people from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, from all over Judea, and from east of the Jordan River."
    ],
    [
      "One day as he saw the crowds gathering, Jesus went up on the mountainside and sat down. His disciples gathered around him,",
      "and he began to teach them.",
      "“God blesses those who are poor and realize their need for him,\n    for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.",
      "God blesses those who mourn,\n    for they will be comforted.",
      "God blesses those who are humble,\n    for they will inherit the whole earth.",
      "God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice,\n    for they will be satisfied.",
      "God blesses those who are merciful,\n    for they will be shown mercy.",
      "God blesses those whose hearts are pure,\n    for they will see God.",
      "God blesses those who work for peace,\n    for they will be called the children of God.",
      "God blesses those who are persecuted for doing right,\n    for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.",
      "“God blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers.",
      "Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way.",
      "“You are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor? Can you make it salty again? It will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless.",
      "“You are the light of the world—like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden.",
      "No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where it gives light to everyone in the house.",
      "In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father.",
      "“Don’t misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to accomplish their purpose.",
      "I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not even the smallest detail of God’s law will disappear until its purpose is achieved.",
      "So if you ignore the least commandment and teach others to do the same, you will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But anyone who obeys God’s laws and teaches them will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.",
      "“But I warn you—unless your righteousness is better than the righteousness of the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven!",
      "“You have heard that our ancestors were told, ‘You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are subject to judgment.’",
      "But I say, if you are even angry with someone, you are subject to judgment! If you call someone an idiot, you are in danger of being brought before the court. And if you curse someone, you are in danger of the fires of hell.",
      "“So if you are presenting a sacrifice at the altar in the Temple and you suddenly remember that someone has something against you,",
      "leave your sacrifice there at the altar. Go and be reconciled to that person. Then come and offer your sacrifice to God.",
      "“When you are on the way to court with your adversary, settle your differences quickly. Otherwise, your accuser may hand you over to the judge, who will hand you over to an officer, and you will be thrown into prison.",
      "And if that happens, you surely won’t be free again until you have paid the last penny.",
      "“You have heard the commandment that says, ‘You must not commit adultery.’",
      "But I say, anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.",
      "So if your eye—even your good eye—causes you to lust, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.",
      "And if your hand—even your stronger hand—causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.",
      "“You have heard the law that says, ‘A man can divorce his wife by merely giving her a written notice of divorce.’",
      "But I say that a man who divorces his wife, unless she has been unfaithful, causes her to commit adultery. And anyone who marries a divorced woman also commits adultery.",
      "“You have also heard that our ancestors were told, ‘You must not break your vows; you must carry out the vows you make to the Lord.’",
      "But I say, do not make any vows! Do not say, ‘By heaven!’ because heaven is God’s throne.",
      "And do not say, ‘By the earth!’ because the earth is his footstool. And do not say, ‘By Jerusalem!’ for Jerusalem is the city of the great King.",
      "Do not even say, ‘By my head!’ for you can’t turn one hair white or black.",
      "Just say a simple, ‘Yes, I will,’ or ‘No, I won’t.’ Anything beyond this is from the evil one.",
      "“You have heard the law that says the punishment must match the injury: ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’",
      "But I say, do not resist an evil person! If someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also.",
      "If you are sued in court and your shirt is taken from you, give your coat, too.",
      "If a soldier demands that you carry his gear for a mile, carry it two miles.",
      "Give to those who ask, and don’t turn away from those who want to borrow.",
      "“You have heard the law that says, ‘Love your neighbor’ and hate your enemy.",
      "But I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you!",
      "In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike.",
      "If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much.",
      "If you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that.",

      "“And he will answer, ‘I tell you the truth, when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were refusing to help me.’",
      "“And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life.”"

      "When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,",
      "“As you know, Passover begins in two days, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”",
      "At that same time the leading priests and elders were meeting at the residence of Caiaphas, the high priest,",
      "plotting how to capture Jesus secretly and kill him.",
      "“But not during the Passover celebration,” they agreed, “or the people may riot.”",
      "Meanwhile, Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon, a man who had previously had leprosy.",
      "While he was eating, a woman came in with a beautiful alabaster jar of expensive perfume and poured it over his head.",
      "The disciples were indignant when they saw this. “What a waste!” they said.",
      "“It could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor.”",
      "But Jesus, aware of this, replied, “Why criticize this woman for doing such a good thing to me?",
      "You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.",
      "She has poured this perfume on me to prepare my body for burial.",
      "I tell you the truth, wherever the Good News is preached throughout the world, this woman’s deed will be remembered and discussed.”",
      "Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the leading priests",
      "and asked, “How much will you pay me to betray Jesus to you?” And they gave him thirty pieces of silver.",
      "From that time on, Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus.",
      "On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?”",
      "“As you go into the city,” he told them, “you will see a certain man. Tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My time has come, and I will eat the Passover meal with my disciples at your house.’”",
      "So the disciples did as Jesus told them and prepared the Passover meal there.",
      "When it was evening, Jesus sat down at the table with the Twelve.",
      "While they were eating, he said, “I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.”",
      "Greatly distressed, each one asked in turn, “Am I the one, Lord?”",
      "He replied, “One of you who has just eaten from this bowl with me will betray me.",
      "For the Son of Man must die, as the Scriptures declared long ago. But how terrible it will be for the one who betrays him. It would be far better for that man if he had never been born!”",
      "Judas, the one who would betray him, also asked, “Rabbi, am I the one?”\nAnd Jesus told him, “You have said it.”",
      "As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, “Take this and eat it, for this is my body.”",
      "And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them and said, “Each of you drink from it,",
      "for this is my blood, which confirms the covenant between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice to forgive the sins of many.",
      "Mark my words—I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”",
      "Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.",
      "On the way, Jesus told them, “Tonight all of you will desert me. For the Scriptures say,\n‘God will strike the Shepherd,\n    and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’",
      "But after I have been raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet you there.”",
      "Peter declared, “Even if everyone else deserts you, I will never desert you.”",
      "Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, Peter—this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you even know me.”",
      "“No!” Peter insisted. “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the other disciples vowed the same.",
      "Then Jesus went with them to the olive grove called Gethsemane, and he said, “Sit here while I go over there to pray.”",
      "He took Peter and Zebedee’s two sons, James and John, and he became anguished and distressed.",
      "He told them, “My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”",
      "He went on a little farther and bowed with his face to the ground, praying, “My Father! If it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine.”",
      "Then he returned to the disciples and found them asleep. He said to Peter, “Couldn’t you watch with me even one hour?",
      "Keep watch and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak!”",
      "Then Jesus left them a second time and prayed, “My Father! If this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will be done.”",
      "When he returned to them again, he found them sleeping, for they couldn’t keep their eyes open.",
      "So he went to pray a third time, saying the same things again.",
      "Then he came to the disciples and said, “Go ahead and sleep. Have your rest. But look—the time has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.",
      "Up, let’s be going. Look, my betrayer is here!”",
      "And even as Jesus said this, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the leading priests and elders of the people.",
      "The traitor, Judas, had given them a prearranged signal: “You will know which one to arrest when I greet him with a kiss.”",
      "So Judas came straight to Jesus. “Greetings, Rabbi!” he exclaimed and gave him the kiss.",
      "Jesus said, “My friend, go ahead and do what you have come for.”\nThen the others grabbed Jesus and arrested him.",
      "But one of the men with Jesus pulled out his sword and struck the high priest’s slave, slashing off his ear.",
      "“Put away your sword,” Jesus told him. “Those who use the sword will die by the sword.",
      "Don’t you realize that I could ask my Father for thousands of angels to protect us, and he would send them instantly?",
      "But if I did, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that describe what must happen now?”",
      "Then Jesus said to the crowd, “Am I some dangerous revolutionary, that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me? Why didn’t you arrest me in the Temple? I was there teaching every day.",
      "But this is all happening to fulfill the words of the prophets as recorded in the Scriptures.” At that point, all the disciples deserted him and fled.",
      "Then the people who had arrested Jesus led him to the home of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of religious law and the elders had gathered.",
      "Meanwhile, Peter followed him at a distance and came to the high priest’s courtyard. He went in and sat with the guards and waited to see how it would all end.",
      "Inside, the leading priests and the entire high council were trying to find witnesses who would lie about Jesus, so they could put him to death.",
      "But even though they found many who agreed to give false witness, they could not use anyone’s testimony. Finally, two men came forward",
      "who declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”",
      "Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Well, aren’t you going to answer these charges? What do you have to say for yourself?”",
      "But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I demand in the name of the living God—tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”",
      "Jesus replied, “You have said it. And in the future you will see the Son of Man seated in the place of power at God’s right hand and coming on the clouds of heaven.”",
      "Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said, “Blasphemy! Why do we need other witnesses? You have all heard his blasphemy.",
      "What is your verdict?”\n“Guilty!” they shouted. “He deserves to die!”",
      "Then they began to spit in Jesus’ face and beat him with their fists. And some slapped him,",
      "jeering, “Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you that time?”",
      "Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came over and said to him, “You were one of those with Jesus the Galilean.”",
      "But Peter denied it in front of everyone. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.",
      "Later, out by the gate, another servant girl noticed him and said to those standing around, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”",
      "Again Peter denied it, this time with an oath. “I don’t even know the man,” he said.",
      "A little later some of the other bystanders came over to Peter and said, “You must be one of them; we can tell by your Galilean accent.”",
      "Peter swore, “A curse on me if I’m lying—I don’t know the man!” And immediately the rooster crowed.",
      "Suddenly, Jesus’ words flashed through Peter’s mind: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you even know me.” And he went away, weeping bitterly."

      "Very early in the morning the leading priests and the elders of the people met again to lay plans for putting Jesus to death.",
      "Then they bound him, led him away, and took him to Pilate, the Roman governor.",
      "When Judas, who had betrayed him, realized that Jesus had been condemned to die, he was filled with remorse. So he took the thirty pieces of silver back to the leading priests and the elders.",
      "“I have sinned,” he declared, “for I have betrayed an innocent man.”\n“What do we care?” they retorted. “That’s your problem.”",
      "Then Judas threw the silver coins down in the Temple and went out and hanged himself.",
      "The leading priests picked up the coins. “It wouldn’t be right to put this money in the Temple treasury,” they said, “since it was payment for murder.”",
      "After some discussion they finally decided to buy the potter’s field, and they made it into a cemetery for foreigners.",
      "That is why the field is still called the Field of Blood.",
      "This fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah that says,\n“They took the thirty pieces of silver—\n    the price at which he was valued by the people of Israel,",
      "and purchased the potter’s field,\n    as the Lord directed.”",
      "Now Jesus was standing before Pilate, the Roman governor. “Are you the king of the Jews?” the governor asked him.\nJesus replied, “You have said it.”",
      "But when the leading priests and the elders made their accusations against him, Jesus remained silent.",
      "“Don’t you hear all these charges they are bringing against you?” Pilate demanded.",
      "But Jesus made no response to any of the charges, much to the governor’s surprise.",
      "Now it was the governor’s custom each year during the Passover celebration to release one prisoner to the crowd—anyone they wanted.",
      "This year there was a notorious prisoner, a man named Barabbas.",
      "As the crowds gathered before Pilate’s house that morning, he asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you—Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”",
      "(He knew very well that the religious leaders had arrested Jesus out of envy.)",
      "Just then, as Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message: “Leave that innocent man alone. I suffered through a terrible nightmare about him last night.”",
      "Meanwhile, the leading priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be released and for Jesus to be put to death.",
      "So the governor asked again, “Which of these two do you want me to release to you?”\nThe crowd shouted back, “Barabbas!”",
      "Pilate responded, “Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?”\nThey shouted back, “Crucify him!”",
      "“Why?” Pilate demanded. “What crime has he committed?”\nBut the mob roared even louder, “Crucify him!”",
      "Pilate saw that he wasn’t getting anywhere and that a riot was developing. So he sent for a bowl of water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood. The responsibility is yours!”",
      "And all the people yelled back, “We will take responsibility for his death—we and our children!”",
      "So Pilate released Barabbas to them. He ordered Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip, then turned him over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified.",
      "Some of the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into their headquarters and called out the entire regiment.",
      "They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.",
      "They wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head, and they placed a reed stick in his right hand as a scepter. Then they knelt before him in mockery and taunted, “Hail! King of the Jews!”",
      "And they spit on him and grabbed the stick and struck him on the head with it.",
      "When they were finally tired of mocking him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified.",
      "Along the way, they came across a man named Simon, who was from Cyrene, and the soldiers forced him to carry Jesus’ cross.",
      "And they went out to a place called Golgotha (which means “Place of the Skull”).",
      "The soldiers gave Jesus wine mixed with bitter gall, but when he had tasted it, he refused to drink it.",
      "After they had nailed him to the cross, the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice.",
      "Then they sat around and kept guard as he hung there.",
      "A sign was fastened above Jesus’ head, announcing the charge against him. It read: “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”",
      "Two revolutionaries were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.",
      "The people passing by shouted abuse, shaking their heads in mockery.",
      "“Look at you now!” they yelled at him. “You said you were going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days. Well then, if you are the Son of God, save yourself and come down from the cross!”",
      "The leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders also mocked Jesus.",
      "“He saved others,” they scoffed, “but he can’t save himself! So he is the King of Israel, is he? Let him come down from the cross right now, and we will believe in him!",
      "He trusted God, so let God rescue him now if he wants him! For he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”",
      "Even the revolutionaries who were crucified with him ridiculed him in the same way.",
      "At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until three o’clock.",
      "At about three o’clock, Jesus called out with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” which means “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”",
      "Some of the bystanders misunderstood and thought he was calling for the prophet Elijah.",
      "One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, holding it up to him on a reed stick so he could drink.",
      "But the rest said, “Wait! Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”",
      "Then Jesus shouted out again, and he released his spirit.",
      "At that moment the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, rocks split apart,",
      "and tombs opened. The bodies of many godly men and women who had died were raised from the dead.",
      "They left the cemetery after Jesus’ resurrection, went into the holy city of Jerusalem, and appeared to many people.",
      "The Roman officer and the other soldiers at the crucifixion were terrified by the earthquake and all that had happened. They said, “This man truly was the Son of God!”",
      "And many women who had come from Galilee with Jesus to care for him were watching from a distance.",
      "Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James and Joseph), and the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee.",
      "As evening approached, Joseph, a rich man from Arimathea who had become a follower of Jesus,",
      "went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. And Pilate issued an order to release it to him.",
      "Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a long sheet of clean linen cloth.",
      "He placed it in his own new tomb, which had been carved out of the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance and left.",
      "Both Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting across from the tomb and watching.",
      "The next day, on the Sabbath, the leading priests and Pharisees went to see Pilate.",
      "They told him, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver once said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise from the dead.’",
      "So we request that you seal the tomb until the third day. This will prevent his disciples from coming and stealing his body and then telling everyone he was raised from the dead! If that happens, we’ll be worse off than we were at first.”",
      "Pilate replied, “Take guards and secure it the best you can.”",
      "So they sealed the tomb and posted guards to protect it."

      "Early on Sunday morning, as the new day was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went out to visit the tomb.",
      "Suddenly there was a great earthquake! For an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, rolled aside the stone, and sat on it.",
      "His face shone like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow.",
      "The guards shook with fear when they saw him, and they fell into a dead faint.",
      "Then the angel spoke to the women. “Don’t be afraid!” he said. “I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.",
      "He isn’t here! He is risen from the dead, just as he said would happen. Come, see where his body was lying.",
      "And now, go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there. Remember what I have told you.”",
      "The women ran quickly from the tomb. They were very frightened but also filled with great joy, and they rushed to give the disciples the angel’s message.",
      "And as they went, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they ran to him, grasped his feet, and worshiped him.",
      "Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t be afraid! Go tell my brothers to leave for Galilee, and they will see me there.”",
      "As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the leading priests what had happened.",
      "A meeting with the elders was called, and they decided to give the soldiers a large bribe.",
      "They told the soldiers, “You must say, ‘Jesus’ disciples came during the night while we were sleeping, and they stole his body.’",
      "If the governor hears about it, we’ll stand up for you so you won’t get in trouble.”",
      "So the guards accepted the bribe and said what they were told to say. Their story spread widely among the Jews, and they still tell it today.",
      "Then the eleven disciples left for Galilee, going to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.",
      "When they saw him, they worshiped him—but some of them doubted!",
      "Jesus came and told his disciples, “I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth.",
      "Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.",
      "Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”"
