      "What do people gain from all their labors\n    at which they toil under the sun?",
      "Generations come and generations go,\n    but the earth remains forever.",
      "The sun rises and the sun sets,\n    and hurries back to where it rises.",

      "All things are wearisome,\n    more than one can say.\nThe eye never has enough of seeing,\n    nor the ear its fill of hearing.",
      "What has been will be again,\n    what has been done will be done again;\n    there is nothing new under the sun.",
      "Is there anything of which one can say,\n    “Look! This is something new”?\nIt was here already, long ago;\n    it was here before our time.",
      "No one remembers the former generations,\n    and even those yet to come\nwill not be remembered\n    by those who follow them.",
      "I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
      "I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind!",
      "I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.",
      "What is crooked cannot be straightened;\n    what is lacking cannot be counted.",
      "I said to myself, “Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.”",
      "Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.",

      "I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.",
      "I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.",

      "I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.",
      "I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem as well—the delights of a man’s heart.",
      "I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.",
      "I denied myself nothing my eyes desired;\n    I refused my heart no pleasure.\nMy heart took delight in all my labor,\n    and this was the reward for all my toil.",

      "For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered;\n    the days have already come when both have been forgotten.\nLike the fool, the wise too must die!",
      "So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.",
      "I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.",
      "And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.",
      "So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.",
      "For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.",
      "What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun?",

      "Remember your Creator\n    in the days of your youth,\nbefore the days of trouble come\n    and the years approach when you will say,\n    “I find no pleasure in them”—",
      "before the sun and the light\n    and the moon and the stars grow dark,\n    and the clouds return after the rain;",
      "when the keepers of the house tremble,\n    and the strong men stoop,\nwhen the grinders cease because they are few,\n    and those looking through the windows grow dim;",
      "when the doors to the street are closed\n    and the sound of grinding fades;\nwhen people rise up at the sound of birds,\n    but all their songs grow faint;",
      "when people are afraid of heights\n    and of dangers in the streets;\nwhen the almond tree blossoms\n    and the grasshopper drags itself along\n    and desire no longer is stirred.\nThen people go to their eternal home\n    and mourners go about the streets.",
      "Remember him—before the silver cord is severed,\n    and the golden bowl is broken;\nbefore the pitcher is shattered at the spring,\n    and the wheel broken at the well,",
      "and the dust returns to the ground it came from,\n    and the spirit returns to God who gave it.",
      "“Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher.\n    “Everything is meaningless!”",
      "Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.",
      "The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.",
      "The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one shepherd.",
      "Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.\nOf making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.",
      "Now all has been heard;\n    here is the conclusion of the matter:\nFear God and keep his commandments,\n    for this is the duty of all mankind.",
      "For God will bring every deed into judgment,\n    including every hidden thing,\n    whether it is good or evil."
