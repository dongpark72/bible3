      "How deserted lies the city,\n    once so full of people!\nHow like a widow is she,\n    who once was great among the nations!\nShe who was queen among the provinces\n    has now become a slave.",
      "Bitterly she weeps at night,\n    tears are on her cheeks.\nAmong all her lovers\n    there is no one to comfort her.\nAll her friends have betrayed her;\n    they have become her enemies.",
      "After affliction and harsh labor,\n    Judah has gone into exile.\nShe dwells among the nations;\n    she finds no resting place.\nAll who pursue her have overtaken her\n    in the midst of her distress.",
      "The roads to Zion mourn,\n    for no one comes to her appointed festivals.\nAll her gateways are desolate,\n    her priests groan,\nher young women grieve,\n    and she is in bitter anguish.",

      "In the days of her affliction and wandering\n    Jerusalem remembers all the treasures\n    that were hers in days of old.\nWhen her people fell into enemy hands,\n    there was no one to help her.\nHer enemies looked at her\n    and laughed at her destruction.",
      "Jerusalem has sinned greatly\n    and so has become unclean.\nAll who honored her despise her,\n    for they have all seen her naked;\nshe herself groans\n    and turns away.",

      "“People have heard my groaning,\n    but there is no one to comfort me.\nAll my enemies have heard of my distress;\n    they rejoice at what you have done.\nMay you bring the day you have announced\n    so they may become like me.",
      "“Let all their wickedness come before you;\n    deal with them\nas you have dealt with me\n    because of all my sins.\nMy groans are many\n    and my heart is faint.”"

      "Without pity the Lord has swallowed up\n    all the dwellings of Jacob;\nin his wrath he has torn down\n    the strongholds of Daughter Judah.\nHe has brought her kingdom and its princes\n    down to the ground in dishonor.",
      "In fierce anger he has cut off\n    every horn of Israel.\nHe has withdrawn his right hand\n    at the approach of the enemy.\nHe has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire\n    that consumes everything around it.",
      "Like an enemy he has strung his bow;\n    his right hand is ready.\nLike a foe he has slain\n    all who were pleasing to the eye;\nhe has poured out his wrath like fire\n    on the tent of Daughter Zion.",

      "What can I say for you?\n    With what can I compare you,\n    Daughter Jerusalem?\nTo what can I liken you,\n    that I may comfort you,\n    Virgin Daughter Zion?\nYour wound is as deep as the sea.\n    Who can heal you?",
      "The visions of your prophets\n    were false and worthless;\nthey did not expose your sin\n    to ward off your captivity.\nThe prophecies they gave you\n    were false and misleading.",
      "All who pass your way\n    clap their hands at you;\nthey scoff and shake their heads\n    at Daughter Jerusalem:\n“Is this the city that was called\n    the perfection of beauty,\n    the joy of the whole earth?”",
      "All your enemies open their mouths\n    wide against you;\nthey scoff and gnash their teeth\n    and say, “We have swallowed her up.\nThis is the day we have waited for;\n    we have lived to see it.”",
      "The Lord has done what he planned;\n    he has fulfilled his word,\n    which he decreed long ago.\nHe has overthrown you without pity,\n    he has let the enemy gloat over you,\n    he has exalted the horn of your foes.",
      "The hearts of the people\n    cry out to the Lord.\nYou walls of Daughter Zion,\n    let your tears flow like a river\n    day and night;\ngive yourself no relief,\n    your eyes no rest.",
      "Arise, cry out in the night,\n    as the watches of the night begin;\npour out your heart like water\n    in the presence of the Lord.\nLift up your hands to him\n    for the lives of your children,\nwho faint from hunger\n    at every street corner.",
      "“Look, Lord, and consider:\n    Whom have you ever treated like this?\nShould women eat their offspring,\n    the children they have cared for?\nShould priest and prophet be killed\n    in the sanctuary of the Lord?",
      "“Young and old lie together\n    in the dust of the streets;\nmy young men and young women\n    have fallen by the sword.\nYou have slain them in the day of your anger;\n    you have slaughtered them without pity.",
      "“As you summon to a feast day,\n    so you summoned against me terrors on every side.\nIn the day of the Lord’s anger\n    no one escaped or survived;\nthose I cared for and reared\n    my enemy has destroyed.”"
