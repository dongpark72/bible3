      "Your rulers are rebels,\n    partners with thieves;\nthey all love bribes\n    and chase after gifts.\nThey do not defend the cause of the fatherless;\n    the widow’s case does not come before them.",
      "Therefore the Lord, the Lord Almighty,\n    the Mighty One of Israel, declares:\n“Ah! I will vent my wrath on my foes\n    and avenge myself on my enemies.",
      "I will turn my hand against you;\n    I will thoroughly purge away your dross\n    and remove all your impurities.",
      "I will restore your leaders as in days of old,\n    your rulers as at the beginning.\nAfterward you will be called\n    the City of Righteousness,\n    the Faithful City.”",
      "Zion will be delivered with justice,\n    her penitent ones with righteousness.",
      "But rebels and sinners will both be broken,\n    and those who forsake the Lord will perish.",
      "“You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks\n    in which you have delighted;\nyou will be disgraced because of the gardens\n    that you have chosen.",
      "You will be like an oak with fading leaves,\n    like a garden without water.",
